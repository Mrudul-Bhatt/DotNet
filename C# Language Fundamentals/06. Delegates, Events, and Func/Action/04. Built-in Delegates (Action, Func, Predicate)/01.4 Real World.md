Let's explore these scenarios to understand the practical application of `Predicate<T>`, `Func<T, TResult>`, and `Action` delegates in C\#.

### You need to sort a list of complex objects—how would you use a Predicate to filter them before sorting?

While `Predicate<T>` is specifically designed for filtering (returning a `bool`), it's generally used with methods like `List<T>.FindAll`, `List<T>.RemoveAll`, or `List<T>.Exists`. For filtering *before* sorting with LINQ, you'd typically use the `Where` extension method, which internally takes a `Func<TSource, bool>` (effectively a predicate).

However, if you had a pre-defined `Predicate<T>` and wanted to use it with LINQ's `Where`, you'd still use it, though implicitly it would be treated as a `Func<TSource, bool>`.

**Scenario:** You have a list of `Employee` objects, and you want to first filter for active employees who earn more than a certain salary, and then sort them by their last name.

```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public decimal Salary { get; set; }
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"{FirstName} {LastName} (ID: {Id}, Salary: {Salary:C}, Active: {IsActive})";
    }
}

public static void FilterAndSortExample()
{
    List<Employee> employees = new List<Employee>
    {
        new Employee { Id = 1, FirstName = "Alice", LastName = "Smith", Salary = 70000m, IsActive = true },
        new Employee { Id = 2, FirstName = "Bob", LastName = "Johnson", Salary = 55000m, IsActive = false },
        new Employee { Id = 3, FirstName = "Charlie", LastName = "Brown", Salary = 80000m, IsActive = true },
        new Employee { Id = 4, FirstName = "Diana", LastName = "Miller", Salary = 65000m, IsActive = true },
        new Employee { Id = 5, FirstName = "Eve", LastName = "Davis", Salary = 90000m, IsActive = false },
        new Employee { Id = 6, FirstName = "Frank", LastName = "White", Salary = 72000m, IsActive = true }
    };

    // Define a Predicate<Employee> for filtering criteria
    Predicate<Employee> isActiveAndHighEarner = emp => emp.IsActive && emp.Salary > 60000m;

    // Method 1: Using Predicate with List<T>.FindAll() then LINQ OrderBy
    List<Employee> filteredByPredicate = employees.FindAll(isActiveAndHighEarner);
    var sortedFilteredEmployees1 = filteredByPredicate.OrderBy(emp => emp.LastName).ToList();

    Console.WriteLine("--- Filtered & Sorted (Method 1: Predicate + FindAll) ---");
    foreach (var emp in sortedFilteredEmployees1)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(emp);
    }

    Console.WriteLine("\n--- Filtered & Sorted (Method 2: LINQ Where) ---");
    // Method 2: The more common LINQ approach (lambda here is implicitly a Func<Employee, bool>)
    var sortedFilteredEmployees2 = employees
        .Where(emp => isActiveAndHighEarner(emp)) // Using the predicate here as a Func<Employee, bool>
        .OrderBy(emp => emp.LastName)
        .ToList();

    foreach (var emp in sortedFilteredEmployees2)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(emp);
    }

    /* Expected Output (for both methods):
    --- Filtered & Sorted (Method 1: Predicate + FindAll) ---
    Charlie Brown (ID: 3, Salary: ₹80,000.00, Active: True)
    Diana Miller (ID: 4, Salary: ₹65,000.00, Active: True)
    Alice Smith (ID: 1, Salary: ₹70,000.00, Active: True)
    Frank White (ID: 6, Salary: ₹72,000.00, Active: True)

    --- Filtered & Sorted (Method 2: LINQ Where) ---
    Charlie Brown (ID: 3, Salary: ₹80,000.00, Active: True)
    Diana Miller (ID: 4, Salary: ₹65,000.00, Active: True)
    Alice Smith (ID: 1, Salary: ₹70,000.00, Active: True)
    Frank White (ID: 6, Salary: ₹72,000.00, Active: True)
    */
}
```

In this example, `isActiveAndHighEarner` is a `Predicate<Employee>` that encapsulates the filtering logic. We then use this predicate in two ways:

1.  With `List<T>.FindAll()`, which directly accepts a `Predicate<T>`.
2.  With LINQ's `Where()` method. While `Where` technically expects a `Func<TSource, bool>`, a `Predicate<T>` is fully compatible and can be invoked within the lambda (as `isActiveAndHighEarner(emp)`). The key simplification is that the *filtering rule itself* is defined once and reusable.

### You want to delay execution of business logic until runtime—how would you use Func to store a rule or expression?

`Func<TResult>` (or `Func<T1, TResult>`, etc.) is perfect for this. It allows you to wrap a piece of code (a method, a lambda expression, an anonymous method) and pass it around as a variable, deferring its actual execution until you *invoke* the `Func`.

**Scenario:** You have a system that calculates user discounts. The specific discount rule might change based on external configuration, user type, or even be defined by an administrator at runtime. You want to store this rule and apply it later when needed.

```csharp
public class Order
{
    public decimal OriginalPrice { get; set; }
    public string CustomerType { get; set; } // e.g., "Regular", "Premium", "VIP"
}

public static void DelayedExecutionExample()
{
    // Define various discount rules as Func<Order, decimal>
    // These rules are *not* executed immediately
    Func<Order, decimal> regularDiscount = order => order.OriginalPrice * 0.05m; // 5% off
    Func<Order, decimal> premiumDiscount = order => order.OriginalPrice * 0.10m; // 10% off
    Func<Order, decimal> vipDiscount = order => Math.Min(order.OriginalPrice * 0.20m, 100m); // 20% off, max ₹100 discount

    // A "default" rule if no specific rule is found
    Func<Order, decimal> noDiscount = order => 0m;

    // Simulate getting an order at runtime
    Order order1 = new Order { OriginalPrice = 200m, CustomerType = "Regular" };
    Order order2 = new Order { OriginalPrice = 500m, CustomerType = "Premium" };
    Order order3 = new Order { OriginalPrice = 700m, CustomerType = "VIP" };
    Order order4 = new Order { OriginalPrice = 100m, CustomerType = "Guest" };

    // Dictionary to store rules, mapping customer type to discount logic
    Dictionary<string, Func<Order, decimal>> discountRules = new Dictionary<string, Func<Order, decimal>>
    {
        { "Regular", regularDiscount },
        { "Premium", premiumDiscount },
        { "VIP", vipDiscount }
    };

    // Function to apply discount based on customer type
    decimal CalculateFinalPrice(Order order)
    {
        // At runtime, retrieve the appropriate Func and invoke it
        Func<Order, decimal> discountCalculator = discountRules.ContainsKey(order.CustomerType)
            ? discountRules[order.CustomerType]
            : noDiscount;

        decimal discountAmount = discountCalculator(order); // Execution happens here!
        return order.OriginalPrice - discountAmount;
    }

    Console.WriteLine($"Order 1 (Regular): Original {order1.OriginalPrice:C}, Final {CalculateFinalPrice(order1):C}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Order 2 (Premium): Original {order2.OriginalPrice:C}, Final {CalculateFinalPrice(order2):C}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Order 3 (VIP): Original {order3.OriginalPrice:C}, Final {CalculateFinalPrice(order3):C}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Order 4 (Guest): Original {order4.OriginalPrice:C}, Final {CalculateFinalPrice(order4):C}");

    /* Expected Output:
    Order 1 (Regular): Original ₹200.00, Final ₹190.00
    Order 2 (Premium): Original ₹500.00, Final ₹450.00
    Order 3 (VIP): Original ₹700.00, Final ₹600.00
    Order 4 (Guest): Original ₹100.00, Final ₹100.00
    */
}
```

In this example, the actual discount calculation logic (e.g., `order.OriginalPrice * 0.05m`) is encapsulated within `Func<Order, decimal>` delegates. These delegates are stored in a dictionary and only invoked (`discountCalculator(order)`) when `CalculateFinalPrice` is called at runtime for a specific order. This allows us to define and manage multiple rules independently and apply the correct one dynamically.

### You’re building a workflow engine—how can Action delegates help define modular processing steps?

`Action` delegates are ideal for defining modular, executable steps in a workflow because they represent methods that perform an operation but do not return a value. Each `Action` can encapsulate a discrete unit of work.

**Scenario:** You're building a simple order processing workflow. The steps might include validating the order, reserving inventory, processing payment, and sending a confirmation email. Each of these can be an `Action`.

```csharp
public class OrderProcessor
{
    public void ProcessOrder(string orderId)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Starting workflow for Order: {orderId}");

        // Define workflow steps as Action<string> delegates
        Action<string> validateOrder = id => Console.WriteLine($"Step 1: Validating order {id}...");
        Action<string> reserveInventory = id => Console.WriteLine($"Step 2: Reserving inventory for order {id}...");
        Action<string> processPayment = id => Console.WriteLine($"Step 3: Processing payment for order {id}...");
        Action<string> sendConfirmationEmail = id => Console.WriteLine($"Step 4: Sending confirmation email for order {id}...");
        Action<string> logCompletion = id => Console.WriteLine($"Workflow for order {id} completed.");

        // Store the steps in a list, defining the sequence
        List<Action<string>> workflowSteps = new List<Action<string>>
        {
            validateOrder,
            reserveInventory,
            processPayment,
            sendConfirmationEmail,
            logCompletion
        };

        // Execute each step in sequence
        foreach (var step in workflowSteps)
        {
            try
            {
                step(orderId); // Execute the action with the orderId
                // Simulate potential failure for demonstration
                if (step == reserveInventory && orderId == "ORD_FAIL")
                {
                    throw new Exception("Inventory reservation failed!");
                }
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Workflow Error for {orderId}: {ex.Message}. Aborting workflow.");
                return; // Stop processing on error
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"Finished workflow for Order: {orderId}\n");
    }
}

public static void WorkflowEngineExample()
{
    OrderProcessor processor = new OrderProcessor();
    processor.ProcessOrder("ORD_123");
    processor.ProcessOrder("ORD_FAIL"); // Demonstrate a failure
}

/* Expected Output:
Starting workflow for Order: ORD_123
Step 1: Validating order ORD_123...
Step 2: Reserving inventory for order ORD_123...
Step 3: Processing payment for order ORD_123...
Step 4: Sending confirmation email for order ORD_123...
Workflow for order ORD_123 completed.
Finished workflow for Order: ORD_123

Starting workflow for Order: ORD_FAIL
Step 1: Validating order ORD_FAIL...
Step 2: Reserving inventory for order ORD_FAIL...
Workflow Error for ORD_FAIL: Inventory reservation failed!. Aborting workflow.
*/
```

Here, each step of the order processing workflow is an `Action<string>`. These actions are stored in a list, defining the sequence. The `ProcessOrder` method then iterates through this list, executing each `Action` in turn. This makes the workflow highly modular: you can easily add, remove, or reorder steps, or even create different workflows by composing different `Action` lists.

### In a report generation module, how would Func\<T, TResult\> help you parameterize data transformations?

`Func<T, TResult>` is invaluable for parameterizing data transformations because it allows you to pass a function that defines *how* an input of type `T` should be converted into an output of type `TResult`. This promotes reusability and flexibility in report generation.

**Scenario:** You're generating a report of sales data. You might need to display product names in different formats (e.g., uppercase, shortened, with a prefix), calculate sales figures in various currencies, or aggregate data in different ways.

```csharp
public class SalesRecord
{
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public decimal Quantity { get; set; }
    public decimal UnitPrice { get; set; }
    public DateTime SaleDate { get; set; }

    public decimal TotalSale => Quantity * UnitPrice;
}

public static class ReportGenerator
{
    public static void GenerateSalesReport<TOutput>(
        string title,
        IEnumerable<SalesRecord> salesData,
        Func<SalesRecord, TOutput> dataTransformer) // Accepts a Func for transformation
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"\n--- {title} ---");
        foreach (var record in salesData)
        {
            TOutput transformedData = dataTransformer(record); // Apply the passed-in transformation
            Console.WriteLine(transformedData);
        }
        Console.WriteLine("--------------------\n");
    }
}

public static void ReportGenerationExample()
{
    List<SalesRecord> sales = new List<SalesRecord>
    {
        new SalesRecord { ProductName = "Laptop", Quantity = 1, UnitPrice = 1200m, SaleDate = DateTime.Now },
        new SalesRecord { ProductName = "Mouse", Quantity = 5, UnitPrice = 25m, SaleDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1) },
        new SalesRecord { ProductName = "Keyboard", Quantity = 2, UnitPrice = 75m, SaleDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-2) }
    };

    // Transformation 1: Basic product name and total sale
    Func<SalesRecord, string> basicTransformer = record =>
        $"{record.ProductName}: {record.TotalSale:C}";

    ReportGenerator.GenerateSalesReport("Basic Sales Report", sales, basicTransformer);

    // Transformation 2: Uppercase product name and total sale in USD (simulated conversion)
    Func<SalesRecord, string> usdTransformer = record =>
        $"{record.ProductName.ToUpper()} (USD): {record.TotalSale / 83.5m:C}"; // Assuming 1 USD = 83.5 INR

    ReportGenerator.GenerateSalesReport("USD Sales Report", sales, usdTransformer);

    // Transformation 3: Anonymous type for detailed report
    Func<SalesRecord, object> detailedTransformer = record => new
    {
        Product = record.ProductName,
        Total = record.TotalSale,
        Date = record.SaleDate.ToShortDateString(),
        QuantitySold = record.Quantity
    };

    ReportGenerator.GenerateSalesReport("Detailed Sales Report", sales, detailedTransformer);

    /* Expected Output (currency symbols may vary based on locale):
    --- Basic Sales Report ---
    Laptop: ₹1,200.00
    Mouse: ₹125.00
    Keyboard: ₹150.00
    --------------------

    --- USD Sales Report ---
    LAPTOP (USD): $14.37
    MOUSE (USD): $1.50
    KEYBOARD (USD): $1.80
    --------------------

    --- Detailed Sales Report ---
    { Product = Laptop, Total = 1200, Date = 02-07-2025, QuantitySold = 1 }
    { Product = Mouse, Total = 125, Date = 01-07-2025, QuantitySold = 5 }
    { Product = Keyboard, Total = 150, Date = 30-06-2025, QuantitySold = 2 }
    --------------------
    */
}
```

The `GenerateSalesReport` method takes a `Func<SalesRecord, TOutput>` as a parameter. This `Func` defines how each `SalesRecord` should be transformed into the desired output format (`string` in the first two cases, an anonymous `object` in the third). This makes the `ReportGenerator` highly flexible; you don't need to write a separate `GenerateReport` method for every possible output format.

### You need to log actions taken by a user without modifying the actual logic—how would Action delegates help?

`Action` delegates are excellent for this "cross-cutting concern" because they allow you to inject logging behavior *around* or *after* existing logic without changing the core business code. This adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.

**Scenario:** You have a `UserService` with methods like `CreateUser`, `UpdateUser`, `DeleteUser`. You want to log when these actions are performed, including who performed them and the outcome, without cluttering the `UserService` methods with logging calls.

```csharp
public class UserService
{
    // Public method that can have logging injected
    public void CreateUser(string username, string password)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Creating user: {username}");
        // ... actual user creation logic ...
        Console.WriteLine($"User '{username}' created successfully.");
    }

    public void UpdateUser(string username, string newPassword)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Updating password for user: {username}");
        // ... actual user update logic ...
        Console.WriteLine($"User '{username}' password updated.");
    }

    public void DeleteUser(string username)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Deleting user: {username}");
        // ... actual user deletion logic ...
        Console.WriteLine($"User '{username}' deleted.");
    }
}

public class AuditLogger
{
    public void LogAction(string actor, string actionDescription, bool success)
    {
        string status = success ? "SUCCESS" : "FAILURE";
        Console.WriteLine($"[AUDIT] {DateTime.Now}: User '{actor}' performed '{actionDescription}' - {status}");
        // In a real app, this would write to a log file, database, or logging service
    }
}

public static void LoggingActionsExample()
{
    UserService userService = new UserService();
    AuditLogger logger = new AuditLogger();
    string currentUser = "Admin";

    // Wrap the UserService methods with logging using Action delegates
    Action<string, string> createUserAndLog = (user, pass) =>
    {
        bool success = false;
        try
        {
            userService.CreateUser(user, pass);
            success = true;
        }
        finally
        {
            logger.LogAction(currentUser, $"CreateUser({user})", success);
        }
    };

    Action<string, string> updateUserAndLog = (user, pass) =>
    {
        bool success = false;
        try
        {
            userService.UpdateUser(user, pass);
            success = true;
        }
        finally
        {
            logger.LogAction(currentUser, $"UpdateUser({user})", success);
        }
    };

    Action<string> deleteUserAndLog = (user) =>
    {
        bool success = false;
        try
        {
            userService.DeleteUser(user);
            success = true;
        }
        finally
        {
            logger.LogAction(currentUser, $"DeleteUser({user})", success);
        }
    };

    // Now, call the wrapped actions instead of the direct UserService methods
    createUserAndLog("john_doe", "password123");
    updateUserAndLog("john_doe", "newpass");
    deleteUserAndLog("jane_doe"); // Simulate deleting a non-existent user or an error
    /* Output might vary if 'DeleteUser' actual logic throws an error */
}

/* Expected Output (approximate):
Creating user: john_doe
User 'john_doe' created successfully.
[AUDIT] 02-07-2025 18:33:16: User 'Admin' performed 'CreateUser(john_doe)' - SUCCESS
Updating password for user: john_doe
User 'john_doe' password updated.
[AUDIT] 02-07-2025 18:33:16: User 'Admin' performed 'UpdateUser(john_doe)' - SUCCESS
Deleting user: jane_doe
User 'jane_doe' deleted.
[AUDIT] 02-07-2025 18:33:16: User 'Admin' performed 'DeleteUser(jane_doe)' - SUCCESS
*/
```

In this setup:

  * The `UserService` remains clean, focusing solely on user management logic.
  * The `AuditLogger` is responsible for logging.
  * `Action` delegates (like `createUserAndLog`, `updateUserAndLog`) act as wrappers. They encapsulate the call to the actual business logic (`userService.CreateUser`) and then ensure that the logging logic (`logger.LogAction`) is executed, regardless of whether the primary operation succeeds or fails (thanks to the `finally` block).

This pattern is a simplified form of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), where concerns like logging are separated from the core business logic using techniques often facilitated by delegates.
