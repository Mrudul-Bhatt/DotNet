Let's dive into Events and Event Handlers in C\#, which are a fundamental part of the .NET framework, especially for implementing the publisher-subscriber design pattern.

## Events and Event Handlers in C\#

Events provide a way for a class or object to notify other classes or objects when something interesting happens. They are built on top of delegates and are a key component of the .NET event pattern, facilitating loose coupling between components.

### 1\. Event Keyword and .NET Event Pattern

The `event` keyword is used to declare an event. When you declare an event using the `event` keyword, you're essentially creating a special type of multicast delegate that can only be invoked by the class that declares it. This protects the event from external misuse (e.g., preventing external code from directly invoking the event or clearing all subscriptions).

The **.NET Event Pattern** is a widely adopted convention for declaring and raising events in C\# applications. It typically involves:

  * **A Public Event:** Declared using the `event` keyword and a delegate type.
  * **An `EventHandler` Delegate:** Often the standard `System.EventHandler` or `System.EventHandler<TEventArgs>`.
  * **An `EventArgs` (or derived) Class:** Contains any data related to the event. This allows passing information from the publisher to the subscribers.
  * **A Protected, Virtual `OnEventName` Method:** This method is responsible for safely raising the event. It's protected and virtual to allow derived classes to override the event-raising logic or suppress the event.

**Code Example: Basic .NET Event Pattern**

```csharp
using System;

// 1. Define custom EventArgs class (if event carries data)
// Inherit from System.EventArgs
public class TemperatureChangedEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    public int OldTemperature { get; }
    public int NewTemperature { get; }
    public bool IsBoiling { get; }

    public TemperatureChangedEventArgs(int oldTemp, int newTemp, bool isBoiling)
    {
        OldTemperature = oldTemp;
        NewTemperature = newTemp;
        IsBoiling = isBoiling;
    }
}

// 2. Publisher Class: The class that raises the event
public class Thermostat
{
    private int _currentTemperature;

    public int CurrentTemperature
    {
        get => _currentTemperature;
        set
        {
            if (_currentTemperature != value) // Only raise event if temperature actually changed
            {
                int oldTemp = _currentTemperature;
                _currentTemperature = value;
                Console.WriteLine($"[Thermostat] Temperature changed from {oldTemp}째C to {_currentTemperature}째C.");

                // 4. Raise the event using the protected virtual method
                OnTemperatureChanged(new TemperatureChangedEventArgs(
                    oldTemp,
                    _currentTemperature,
                    _currentTemperature >= 100 // Example condition
                ));
            }
        }
    }

    // 3. Declare the event using the 'event' keyword
    // Uses the generic EventHandler<TEventArgs> delegate
    public event EventHandler<TemperatureChangedEventArgs> TemperatureChanged;

    // 4. Protected, virtual method to raise the event safely
    // This is the recommended pattern: allows derived classes to override
    // and provides a single point of invocation.
    protected virtual void OnTemperatureChanged(TemperatureChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        // Null-conditional operator (?.) is a thread-safe way to invoke an event.
        // It's equivalent to:
        // EventHandler<TemperatureChangedEventArgs> handler = TemperatureChanged;
        // if (handler != null) { handler(this, e); }
        TemperatureChanged?.Invoke(this, e);
    }
}

// 5. Subscriber Class: The class that listens for the event
public class TemperatureDisplay
{
    public string DisplayName { get; set; }

    public TemperatureDisplay(string name)
    {
        DisplayName = name;
    }

    // Method that will handle the event (event handler)
    // Must match the signature of EventHandler<TEventArgs> (object sender, TEventArgs e)
    public void HandleTemperatureChange(object sender, TemperatureChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        Thermostat thermostat = sender as Thermostat; // Cast sender to the publisher type
        string publisherName = (thermostat != null) ? "Thermostat" : "Unknown";

        Console.WriteLine($"  [{DisplayName} Display] Notification from {publisherName}:");
        Console.WriteLine($"    Old Temp: {e.OldTemperature}째C, New Temp: {e.NewTemperature}째C");
        if (e.IsBoiling)
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
            Console.WriteLine("    !!! WARNING: WATER IS BOILING !!!");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }
    }
}

public class BasicEventExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Basic Event Pattern Example ---");

        Thermostat thermostat = new Thermostat();
        TemperatureDisplay livingRoomDisplay = new TemperatureDisplay("Living Room");
        TemperatureDisplay kitchenDisplay = new TemperatureDisplay("Kitchen");

        // 6. Subscribe event handlers to the event
        thermostat.TemperatureChanged += livingRoomDisplay.HandleTemperatureChange;
        thermostat.TemperatureChanged += kitchenDisplay.HandleTemperatureChange;

        // You can also subscribe with anonymous methods or lambdas directly
        thermostat.TemperatureChanged += (sender, e) =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Lambda Logger] Log: Temp changed to {e.NewTemperature}. Boiling status: {e.IsBoiling}");
        };

        // Change temperature, which will raise the event
        thermostat.CurrentTemperature = 20;
        thermostat.CurrentTemperature = 50;
        thermostat.CurrentTemperature = 100; // Triggers boiling warning
        thermostat.CurrentTemperature = 95;  // Temperature change, but not boiling
        thermostat.CurrentTemperature = 95;  // No change, no event
        thermostat.CurrentTemperature = 105; // Back to boiling

        // 7. Unsubscribe an event handler
        thermostat.TemperatureChanged -= livingRoomDisplay.HandleTemperatureChange;
        Console.WriteLine("\nLiving Room Display unsubscribed.");
        thermostat.CurrentTemperature = 80; // Living Room display will no longer receive this
    }
}
```

### 2\. Publisher-Subscriber Model

Events are the cornerstone of the **Publisher-Subscriber (Pub/Sub) design pattern** in C\#.

  * **Publisher:** The object that contains the event and raises it when something happens. It doesn't know anything about the subscribers. It only knows that it has an event that *can be subscribed to*. In the example above, `Thermostat` is the publisher.
  * **Subscriber:** The object that wants to be notified when something happens. It subscribes to the publisher's event by providing an event handler method. It doesn't know anything about how the event is raised, only that it can listen for it. In the example, `TemperatureDisplay` instances are subscribers.

**Key Principles of Pub/Sub with Events:**

  * **Loose Coupling:** The publisher and subscriber are loosely coupled. The publisher doesn't hold direct references to specific subscriber types; it only references a delegate. Subscribers don't need to know the publisher's internal implementation details. This makes components more independent and reusable.
  * **One-to-Many Communication:** A single event can have multiple subscribers. When the publisher raises the event, all subscribed event handlers are invoked.
  * **Flexibility:** Subscribers can be added or removed at runtime without affecting the publisher.

**Illustrated in the Code Example:**

  * `Thermostat` (Publisher) declares `TemperatureChanged`. It never directly calls `livingRoomDisplay.HandleTemperatureChange()` or `kitchenDisplay.HandleTemperatureChange()`.
  * `TemperatureDisplay` (Subscriber) instances subscribe to `thermostat.TemperatureChanged`. They don't know that `Thermostat` has a `CurrentTemperature` property or how `OnTemperatureChanged` is called.
  * When `thermostat.CurrentTemperature` changes, `OnTemperatureChanged` is called, which then invokes the `TemperatureChanged` event. This effectively broadcasts the change to all subscribed `TemperatureDisplay` instances (and the lambda logger), without the `Thermostat` knowing specifically who or what is listening.

### 3\. Custom Event Declarations and Handling

While `EventHandler` and `EventHandler<TEventArgs>` are standard, you can also define your own custom delegate types for events. This is useful when:

  * You don't need to conform to the `(object sender, EventArgs e)` signature (e.g., if you don't need the `sender` or `EventArgs` parameters, though it's generally good practice to include them).
  * You want a very specific, descriptive delegate name for clarity.

**Code Example: Custom Event Delegate**

```csharp
using System;

// 1. Custom Delegate Declaration for the event
public delegate void StockChangeHandler(string productName, int oldStock, int newStock);

// Publisher Class with Custom Event
public class InventoryManager
{
    private Dictionary<string, int> _stockLevels = new Dictionary<string, int>();

    // 2. Custom Event Declaration using the custom delegate
    public event StockChangeHandler StockChanged;

    public InventoryManager()
    {
        _stockLevels.Add("Laptop", 100);
        _stockLevels.Add("Keyboard", 50);
    }

    public void AdjustStock(string productName, int quantityChange)
    {
        if (_stockLevels.ContainsKey(productName))
        {
            int oldStock = _stockLevels[productName];
            int newStock = oldStock + quantityChange;
            _stockLevels[productName] = newStock;

            Console.WriteLine($"[Inventory] Stock for {productName} changed from {oldStock} to {newStock}.");

            // 3. Raise the custom event (no need for OnEventName method for simple cases,
            // but still good practice for larger systems)
            StockChanged?.Invoke(productName, oldStock, newStock);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"[Inventory] Product '{productName}' not found.");
        }
    }
}

// Subscriber Class
public class WarehouseAuditor
{
    public void HandleStockChange(string product, int oldLevel, int newLevel)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"  [Auditor] Audit Log: '{product}' stock changed from {oldLevel} to {newLevel}.");
        if (newLevel < 10)
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
            Console.WriteLine($"    !!! ALERT: {product} stock is low ({newLevel}) !!!");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }
    }
}

public class CustomEventExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Custom Event Delegate Example ---");

        InventoryManager manager = new InventoryManager();
        WarehouseAuditor auditor = new WarehouseAuditor();

        // Subscribe the auditor's method to the custom event
        manager.StockChanged += auditor.HandleStockChange;

        // Also subscribe a lambda
        manager.StockChanged += (prod, oldStk, newStk) =>
        {
            if (newStk == 0)
            {
                Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
                Console.WriteLine($"  [Email Service] Sending email: {prod} is out of stock!");
                Console.ResetColor();
            }
        };

        manager.AdjustStock("Laptop", -10);
        manager.AdjustStock("Keyboard", -45); // Will trigger low stock alert and out of stock email
        manager.AdjustStock("Laptop", 5);
        manager.AdjustStock("Mouse", 20); // Product not found
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**

  * **Delegates are the Foundation:** Events are essentially restricted instances of delegates. The `event` keyword adds a layer of protection and control over delegate instances.
  * **Encapsulation:** The `event` keyword ensures that only the declaring class can invoke the event directly. Other classes can only subscribe (`+=`) or unsubscribe (`-=`).
  * **Standard Pattern:** Adhering to the `.NET Event Pattern` (`EventHandler<TEventArgs>`, `OnEventName` method) is highly recommended for consistency, testability, and extensibility, even if you use a custom `EventArgs` class.
  * **Flexibility with Lambdas:** Anonymous methods and lambda expressions provide a concise way to subscribe to events, especially for short, localized event handling logic.

Events are a fundamental concept for building responsive, modular, and extensible applications in C\#.
