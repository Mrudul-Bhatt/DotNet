Let's break down these aspects of `dynamic` in C\#, including code behavior, best practices, and integration with other features.

-----

### **What will happen when this code runs?**

```csharp
dynamic value = "hello";
Console.WriteLine(value.ToUpper());
value = 123;
Console.WriteLine(value + 5);
```

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what will happen:

1.  **`dynamic value = "hello";`**

      * A local variable named `value` is declared with the compile-time type `dynamic`.
      * The string literal `"hello"` is assigned to `value`. At this point, the *runtime type* of `value` is `string` (System.String).

2.  **`Console.WriteLine(value.ToUpper());`**

      * The compiler sees `value` as `dynamic` and performs no compile-time check for the `ToUpper()` method. It generates DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime) code to resolve this call at runtime.
      * At runtime, the DLR inspects the current value of `value` (which is `"hello"`, a `string`).
      * The DLR successfully finds the `ToUpper()` method on the `string` type.
      * The `ToUpper()` method is invoked, which returns `"HELLO"`.
      * `Console.WriteLine` prints `"HELLO"`.

3.  **`value = 123;`**

      * The `dynamic` variable `value` is reassigned.
      * The integer literal `123` is assigned to `value`. At this point, the *runtime type* of `value` changes from `string` to `int` (System.Int32). This demonstrates the flexibility of `dynamic` variables to hold different runtime types.

4.  **`Console.WriteLine(value + 5);`**

      * The compiler sees `value` as `dynamic` and again defers the `+` operation (addition) to runtime.
      * At runtime, the DLR inspects the current value of `value` (which is `123`, an `int`).
      * The DLR resolves the `+` operator for an `int` and `5` (also an `int`).
      * The addition `123 + 5` is performed, resulting in `128`.
      * `Console.WriteLine` prints `128`.

**Output of the code:**

```
HELLO
128
```

This code demonstrates how `dynamic` variables allow operations to be resolved based on their *runtime* type, enabling flexible behavior that wouldn't be possible with static typing without explicit casting or overloading.

-----

### **What happens if you call a method on a `dynamic` object that doesnâ€™t exist?**

If you call a method on a `dynamic` object that doesn't exist on its *actual runtime type*, a **`Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException`** will be thrown at runtime.

This is the primary risk of using `dynamic`. The compiler performs no checks, so you only discover these errors when the specific line of code executes.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
public class MySimpleClass
{
    public void ExistingMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Existing method called.");
    }
}

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    dynamic myObject = new MySimpleClass();

    Console.WriteLine("Attempting to call an existing method:");
    myObject.ExistingMethod(); // This will work

    Console.WriteLine("\nAttempting to call a non-existent method:");
    try
    {
        myObject.NonExistentMethod(); // This line compiles fine, but will fail at runtime
        Console.WriteLine("This line will not be reached.");
    }
    catch (Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Runtime Error: {ex.Message}");
        // Example error message: "'MySimpleClass' does not contain a definition for 'NonExistentMethod'"
    }

    Console.WriteLine("\nAttempting to call a non-existent property:");
    try
    {
        var value = myObject.NonExistentProperty; // Also fails at runtime
        Console.WriteLine("This line will not be reached.");
    }
    catch (Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Runtime Error: {ex.Message}");
        // Example error message: "'MySimpleClass' does not contain a definition for 'NonExistentProperty'"
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Attempting to call an existing method:
Existing method called.

Attempting to call a non-existent method:
Runtime Error: 'MySimpleClass' does not contain a definition for 'NonExistentMethod'

Attempting to call a non-existent property:
Runtime Error: 'MySimpleClass' does not contain a definition for 'NonExistentProperty'
```

-----

### **Compare this: `object obj = 5;` vs `dynamic dyn = 5;`. What happens when you call `dyn.NonExistentMethod()` vs `obj.NonExistentMethod()`?**

Let's compare the behavior:

#### **`object obj = 5;`**

1.  **Declaration:** `obj` is declared as having the compile-time type `object`. The integer `5` is assigned to it, which involves **boxing** the value type `int` into an `object` reference.

2.  **`obj.NonExistentMethod();`**

      * **Compile-time behavior:** The C\# compiler performs **static type checking**. It looks at the compile-time type of `obj`, which is `object`.
      * The `System.Object` class (the base class for all C\# types) **does not have a method named `NonExistentMethod`**.
      * **Result:** This line will result in a **compile-time error**. The code will not build.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    // Compile-time error: 'object' does not contain a definition for 'NonExistentMethod'
    // and no accessible extension method 'NonExistentMethod' accepting a first argument of type 'object' could be found
    // (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
    // obj.NonExistentMethod();
    ```

#### **`dynamic dyn = 5;`**

1.  **Declaration:** `dyn` is declared as having the compile-time type `dynamic`. The integer `5` is assigned to it.

2.  **`dyn.NonExistentMethod();`**

      * **Compile-time behavior:** The C\# compiler sees `dyn` as `dynamic` and **defers all type checks** for member access to runtime. It trusts that `NonExistentMethod` will be found later. This line **compiles successfully**.
      * **Runtime behavior:** When this line executes, the DLR inspects the *runtime type* of `dyn`, which is `int` (System.Int32).
      * The DLR attempts to find a method named `NonExistentMethod` on the `System.Int32` type.
      * **Result:** The `System.Int32` type **does not have a method named `NonExistentMethod`**. This will result in a **`Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException`** being thrown at runtime.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    dynamic dyn = 5;
    try
    {
        dyn.NonExistentMethod(); // Compiles, but throws RuntimeBinderException
    }
    catch (Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Runtime Error: {ex.Message}");
    }
    ```

**Summary of comparison:**

| Feature               | `object obj = 5; obj.NonExistentMethod();` | `dynamic dyn = 5; dyn.NonExistentMethod();` |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Error Time** | Compile Time                               | Runtime                                     |
| **Error Type** | Compiler Error (`CS1061`)                  | `RuntimeBinderException`                    |
| **Binding Type** | Early (Static) Binding                     | Late (Dynamic) Binding                      |
| **Type Checking** | Strict at Compile Time                     | Deferred to Runtime                         |

### **How can you avoid runtime exceptions when using `dynamic`?**

Avoiding runtime exceptions when using `dynamic` primarily involves a combination of **defensive programming, careful design, and thorough testing**, as the compiler won't help you.

1.  **Know Your Data/Contract:**

      * **Strongly type as soon as possible:** The best way to avoid dynamic runtime errors is to minimize the amount of code that operates on `dynamic` types. Convert the `dynamic` object into a strongly typed object (e.g., a DTO, a known class instance) as soon as you can verify its structure.
      * **Explicit APIs from Dynamic Sources:** If you're working with a dynamic API (like a COM object or JSON), try to encapsulate the `dynamic` interactions within a specific layer or helper class. This layer should then expose strongly typed interfaces or DTOs to the rest of your application.

2.  **Defensive Programming (Runtime Checks):**

      * **`try-catch` blocks:** Wrap dynamic operations in `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle `Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException` (for `dynamic` specific errors) or other potential runtime exceptions (`NullReferenceException`, `InvalidCastException`).
      * **Check for nulls:** Always check if a `dynamic` variable is `null` before attempting to access its members, as `NullReferenceException` can still occur.
      * **Reflection for Existence (if critical):** For very robust scenarios, you might combine `dynamic` with explicit reflection to first check if a member exists before attempting to call it. This adds overhead but provides safety.
        ```csharp
        dynamic data = GetDynamicData();
        if (data.GetType().GetProperty("Name") != null) // Reflection check
        {
            Console.WriteLine(data.Name);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Name property does not exist.");
        }
        ```
      * **Helper methods/extension methods:** Create strongly typed helper methods that take `dynamic` as input but perform internal checks.

3.  **Thorough Testing:**

      * **Unit Tests:** Implement comprehensive unit tests for any code paths involving `dynamic`. Since the compiler won't catch errors, tests are your first line of defense. Cover all expected data structures and edge cases (missing properties, incorrect types).
      * **Integration Tests:** Ensure integration tests cover the interaction with external dynamic systems (COM, web services, etc.).

4.  **Careful Naming and Documentation:**

      * Since IntelliSense is limited, use very clear and descriptive names for your `dynamic` variables.
      * Document the expected structure of the dynamic objects, especially when they come from external sources.

5.  **Use `ExpandoObject` Responsibly:** If you are *creating* dynamic objects with `ExpandoObject`, be precise with property names to avoid typos that would cause `RuntimeBinderException` when read.

**Example of defensive use with `try-catch`:**

```csharp
using System.Dynamic;

public class DataService
{
    public static dynamic GetUserData(string userId)
    {
        // Simulate fetching data, sometimes it's missing or has typos
        if (userId == "user1")
        {
            dynamic user = new ExpandoObject();
            user.UserName = "Alice";
            user.UserAge = 30;
            return user;
        }
        else if (userId == "user2")
        {
            dynamic user = new ExpandoObject();
            user.Username = "Bob"; // Typo! (Username vs UserName)
            user.Age = 25;
            return user;
        }
        return null;
    }

    public static void ProcessUser(string userId)
    {
        dynamic userData = GetUserData(userId);

        if (userData == null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"User '{userId}' not found.");
            return;
        }

        try
        {
            // Attempt to access UserName and UserAge
            string name = userData.UserName; // This will fail for user2
            int age = userData.UserAge;      // This will fail for user2

            Console.WriteLine($"Processing user {name}, age {age}");
        }
        catch (Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error processing user '{userId}': Missing or incorrect property. Details: {ex.Message}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex) // Catch other potential exceptions (e.g., if age was not convertible)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"An unexpected error occurred for user '{userId}': {ex.Message}");
        }
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ProcessUser("user1");
        ProcessUser("user2"); // This will trigger the RuntimeBinderException
        ProcessUser("user3");
    }
}
```

### **How would you write a method that takes either a string or a numeric input using `dynamic`?**

You can use `dynamic` as a method parameter to accept various types, and then use conditional logic (like `if-else if` with `is` or pattern matching) or further dynamic operations to handle the different runtime types.

```csharp
using System;

public class InputProcessor
{
    // Method that accepts dynamic input
    public static void ProcessInput(dynamic input)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"\nProcessing input of runtime type: {input?.GetType().Name ?? "null"}");

        // Approach 1: Using 'is' operator (recommended for type safety)
        if (input is string s)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"It's a string: '{s.ToUpper()}'");
        }
        else if (input is int i)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"It's an integer: {i * 10}");
        }
        else if (input is double d) // Also handles float, decimal implicitly via conversion
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"It's a double: {d / 2.0}");
        }
        else if (input is decimal m)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"It's a decimal: {m * 100m}");
        }
        else if (input == null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Input is null.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Input type not explicitly handled: {input.GetType().Name}");
        }

        // Approach 2: Using dynamic operations (less safe, but concise if types are *guaranteed* to have members)
        // This is less common for "string OR numeric" unless they share a common operation.
        // For example, if you wanted to call a 'GetValue' method on various types:
        // try
        // {
        //     Console.WriteLine($"Attempting dynamic call: {input.GetValue()}");
        // }
        // catch (Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException ex)
        // {
        //     Console.WriteLine($"Dynamic call failed: {ex.Message}");
        // }
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ProcessInput("hello world");
        ProcessInput(42);
        ProcessInput(3.14);
        ProcessInput(12.34m);
        ProcessInput(true); // Will hit "Input type not explicitly handled"
        ProcessInput(null);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

  * By declaring the parameter as `dynamic`, the method `ProcessInput` can accept any type of object at compile time.
  * Inside the method, you use `is` operator checks (or pattern matching with `switch`) to determine the *actual runtime type* of the `input`.
  * Once the type is confirmed, you cast it to the specific type (`string s`, `int i`, etc.) and then perform type-specific operations. This brings back compile-time safety within the `if` blocks.

While `dynamic` allows the flexible parameter, it shifts the responsibility of type handling from compile-time to runtime. Using `is` checks immediately after receiving a `dynamic` input is generally the safest way to work with it.

-----

### **How can you ensure IntelliSense works when using `dynamic` in Visual Studio?**

**You generally cannot ensure full IntelliSense works when using a variable explicitly declared as `dynamic`.** This is by design, as the core purpose of `dynamic` is to defer member resolution to runtime, meaning the IDE simply doesn't know what members will be available.

However, there are a few scenarios and workarounds where you might get *some* form of IntelliSense or at least make your code more IntelliSense-friendly:

1.  **Limited IntelliSense for `dynamic` itself:**

      * When you type `dynamicVar.` (dot after a dynamic variable), Visual Studio *will* show you members of the `System.Object` class (like `ToString()`, `GetType()`, `Equals()`, `GetHashCode()`). This is because all objects inherit from `object`.
      * **For `ExpandoObject` and `DynamicObject` (custom dynamic objects):** If you are working with an `ExpandoObject` or a class that inherits from `DynamicObject` and explicitly adds members using `IDictionary<string, object>` or overrides methods like `TryGetMember`, IntelliSense still won't know those members.

2.  **Casting to a Known Type:**

      * The most effective way to regain IntelliSense is to **cast the `dynamic` variable to a known, strongly-typed variable as soon as possible.**
        ```csharp
        dynamic data = GetDynamicData(); // data is dynamic

        // Option A: Cast and then use
        // Make sure you know the type, or use 'as' with null check
        if (data is MyStronglyTypedClass typedData)
        {
            // Now typedData has full IntelliSense!
            Console.WriteLine(typedData.MyProperty);
        }

        // Option B: Cast immediately if you're certain
        MyStronglyTypedClass certainData = (MyStronglyTypedClass)data;
        // certainData now has full IntelliSense
        Console.WriteLine(certainData.AnotherProperty);
        ```
      * This is the recommended approach to limit the "dynamic zone" of your code.

3.  **Using `var` with Target-Typed Initializers (where `dynamic` isn't the direct initializer):**

      * If a method returns `dynamic`, and you assign it to `var`, the `var` variable will also be `dynamic`, so no IntelliSense.
      * However, if `dynamic` is used internally in a complex expression that ultimately resolves to a static type, `var` will infer that static type, and you'll get IntelliSense.
        ```csharp
        // Assume GetDynamicObject() returns dynamic
        // This will still result in 'result' being dynamic
        // var result = GetDynamicObject().SomeDynamicProperty;

        // But if a method *returns* a static type, even if it uses dynamic internally,
        // then the var will infer the static type.
        // Example: a JSON deserializer that returns a strongly-typed object
        // MyObject myDeserializedObject = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<MyObject>(jsonString);
        // var myObject = MyJsonHelper.DeserializeToStrongType(jsonString); // 'myObject' is MyObject, full IntelliSense.
        ```

**In summary:** When working directly with variables declared as `dynamic`, expect limited IntelliSense. The primary way to enable IntelliSense is to convert the `dynamic` object into a strongly-typed one as quickly as your application logic allows.

-----

### **Can you use `dynamic` in LINQ queries? If yes, any caveats?**

**Yes, you can use `dynamic` within LINQ queries, especially in the `select` clause or when working with data sources that expose dynamic objects.**

However, there are significant caveats and it's generally **not recommended for the entire query pipeline** if you can avoid it, as it undermines LINQ's strong typing benefits.

**Example Use (and Caveats):**

```csharp
using System.Dynamic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class LinqDynamicExample
{
    // Simulate a list of dynamic objects (e.g., from parsing JSON)
    public static List<dynamic> GetDynamicUsers()
    {
        var users = new List<dynamic>();
        dynamic user1 = new ExpandoObject();
        user1.Id = 1;
        user1.Name = "Alice";
        user1.City = "New York";
        users.Add(user1);

        dynamic user2 = new ExpandoObject();
        user2.Id = 2;
        user2.FullName = "Bob Smith"; // Different property name!
        user2.Age = 25; // New property!
        users.Add(user2);

        dynamic user3 = new ExpandoObject();
        user3.Id = 3;
        user3.Name = "Charlie";
        user3.City = "London";
        users.Add(user3);

        return users;
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var dynamicUsers = GetDynamicUsers();

        Console.WriteLine("--- Querying dynamic objects ---");

        // Case 1: Filtering based on a dynamically accessed property (caveat: runtime error if property missing)
        var nyUsers = dynamicUsers.Where(u => u.City == "New York"); // RuntimeBinderException if 'City' is missing
        Console.WriteLine("\nUsers from NY:");
        foreach (var user in nyUsers) // 'user' is dynamic here
        {
            try
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"- {user.Name ?? user.FullName}"); // Handle potentially missing Name/FullName
            }
            catch (Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("- User with missing Name/FullName property.");
            }
        }

        // Case 2: Projecting into an anonymous type (common & generally safe)
        // 'projectedUsers' will be IEnumerable<anonymous type { int UserId, string UserName }>
        var projectedUsers = dynamicUsers.Select(u => new { UserId = u.Id, UserName = (u.Name ?? u.FullName ?? "N/A") });
        Console.WriteLine("\nProjected Users:");
        foreach (var user in projectedUsers) // 'user' is the anonymous type, full IntelliSense here
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"- ID: {user.UserId}, Name: {user.UserName}");
        }

        // Case 3: Chaining dynamic operations (very risky)
        // This will attempt to call 'NonExistentMethod' on each dynamic object
        // If *any* object in the sequence doesn't have it, you get a runtime error.
        // var result = dynamicUsers.Select(u => u.NonExistentMethod()); // Runtime error for every object
    }
}
```

**Caveats of using `dynamic` in LINQ:**

1.  **`RuntimeBinderException` Risks:**
      * Any operation on a `dynamic` object within the LINQ query (`Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`, etc.) will defer member resolution to runtime.
      * If even one object in the collection lacks a property or method being accessed dynamically, or if there's a type mismatch in an operation, a `RuntimeBinderException` will be thrown. This can be hard to debug, especially with lazy evaluation in LINQ queries (the error only occurs when you iterate or materialize the query).
2.  **No IntelliSense in the Query:**
      * Within the lambda expressions (e.g., `u => u.City`), `u` is `dynamic`. This means you get no IntelliSense for `u.City` or any other properties, making typos a high risk.
3.  **Loss of Compile-time Safety:**
      * The primary benefit of LINQ (integrated query with compile-time checks) is significantly reduced when `dynamic` is involved.
4.  **Performance Overhead:**
      * Each dynamic operation within the query (e.g., `u.City` for every item in `Where`) incurs DLR overhead, potentially slowing down query execution.

**Recommendations:**

  * **Project to Anonymous Types/DTOs Immediately:** The safest and most common pattern is to use `dynamic` only to *access* the properties from the source, and then immediately project into an **anonymous type** or a **strongly typed DTO/class**. This brings back compile-time safety for the rest of your query and downstream operations.
      * `dynamicUsers.Select(u => new { Id = u.Id, Name = u.Name })` is a great use case. The `u.Id` and `u.Name` parts are dynamic, but the result is a compile-time anonymous type.
  * **Encapsulate Dynamic Data Source:** If you're querying a dynamic data source (like a `List<dynamic>` from JSON parsing), consider using a helper method or extension method that converts `dynamic` objects to strongly typed DTOs *before* you run complex LINQ queries on them.
    ```csharp
    public static IEnumerable<UserDto> ToUserDtos(this IEnumerable<dynamic> dynamicUsers)
    {
        foreach (var dUser in dynamicUsers)
        {
            yield return new UserDto
            {
                Id = dUser.Id,
                Name = dUser.Name,
                // ... handle missing properties with try-catch or checks
            };
        }
    }
    // Then use: dynamicUsers.ToUserDtos().Where(u => u.City == "New York") // Now strongly typed!
    ```

In summary, `dynamic` can be used in LINQ, but it's generally best confined to the initial data access and transformation into strongly typed (or anonymous) objects to retain the benefits of LINQ's static typing.

### \*\*Is the following valid? If yes, explain how it behaves.

```csharp
dynamic person = new ExpandoObject();
person.Name = "John";
person.Age = 30;
```

**Yes, this code is absolutely valid and represents a common and powerful use case for `dynamic` in C\# with `ExpandoObject`.**

**Explanation of Behavior:**

1.  **`dynamic person = new ExpandoObject();`**

      * A local variable named `person` is declared with the compile-time type `dynamic`.
      * An instance of `ExpandoObject` (from the `System.Dynamic` namespace) is created and assigned to `person`.
      * `ExpandoObject` is a special class in the DLR that allows you to add and remove members (properties, methods, events) at runtime. It implements `IDynamicMetaObjectProvider`, which tells the DLR how to handle dynamic operations on its instances.

2.  **`person.Name = "John";`**

      * At compile time, `person` is `dynamic`, so the compiler allows the assignment to `Name`.
      * At runtime, the DLR encounters this dynamic assignment. Since `person` holds an `ExpandoObject`, the DLR delegates the operation to the `ExpandoObject`'s internal implementation (`IDynamicMetaObjectProvider`).
      * `ExpandoObject` internally uses a `Dictionary<string, object>` to store its members. When `person.Name = "John";` is executed, `ExpandoObject` adds a new key-value pair to its internal dictionary: `{"Name", "John"}`. The property `Name` effectively gets "created" on the `person` object at this moment.

3.  **`person.Age = 30;`**

      * Similar to the previous step, `ExpandoObject` adds another key-value pair to its internal dictionary: `{"Age", 30}`. The `Age` property is also created dynamically.

**How it Behaves (Key Characteristics):**

  * **Runtime Property Creation:** Properties like `Name` and `Age` are not defined in the `ExpandoObject` class itself. They are "added" to the instance dynamically at runtime.
  * **Internal Dictionary Storage:** `ExpandoObject` essentially acts as a wrapper around an internal dictionary (`IDictionary<string, object>`), where property names become keys and property values become dictionary values.
  * **Compile-time Flexibility, Runtime Safety:**
      * You get the flexibility of adding properties without predefined classes.
      * However, if you later try to access `person.Address` without first assigning it, it will result in a `RuntimeBinderException` because `ExpandoObject` won't find "Address" in its internal dictionary.
  * **Type Agnostic Storage:** The values `John` (string) and `30` (int) are stored as `object` internally, but when accessed, the DLR performs appropriate type conversions.
  * **Useful for:**
      * Representing loosely structured data (e.g., from JSON or user-defined schemas).
      * Returning ad-hoc, structured data from methods without defining specific DTO classes.
      * Building dynamic property bags.

**Example of further usage:**

```csharp
dynamic person = new ExpandoObject();
person.Name = "John";
person.Age = 30;
person.Greet = (Action)(() => Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {person.Name}!")); // Add a dynamic method

Console.WriteLine($"Person's name: {person.Name}");
Console.WriteLine($"Person's age: {person.Age}");
person.Greet(); // Invoke the dynamically added method

// Check if a property exists (requires casting to IDictionary or using reflection)
if (((IDictionary<string, object>)person).ContainsKey("Age"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Person has an Age property.");
}
```

This demonstrates that `ExpandoObject` is highly versatile for creating and manipulating dynamic structures.
