Let's explore these advanced scenarios, focusing on the strengths of each abstraction (delegates, interfaces, and expression trees) for specific problems.

### You are building a dynamic filter builder UI—how would you use expression trees to convert user input into executable logic?

This is a classic and powerful application of expression trees. When building a dynamic filter builder UI (e.g., on an e-commerce site for filtering products, or a CRM for filtering leads), the user selects criteria (e.g., "Price \> 100", "Category is 'Electronics'", "InStock = true"). This input needs to be converted into a query that can be executed against a data source, often a database.

**How Expression Trees Help:**

1.  **Parsing User Input:** The UI captures user selections (e.g., field name as string, operator as enum, value as string).
2.  **Building Expression Tree Nodes:** For each user-defined filter, you programmatically construct the corresponding `Expression` objects.
      * `ParameterExpression`: Represents the input object (e.g., `Product p`).
      * `MemberExpression`: Represents accessing a property (e.g., `p.Price`).
      * `ConstantExpression`: Represents the value to compare against (e.g., `100`).
      * `BinaryExpression`: Represents the comparison operator (e.g., `GreaterThan`, `Equal`).
      * `MethodCallExpression`: For methods like `string.Contains`, `DateTime.Date`.
3.  **Combining Expressions:** If the user adds multiple filters, you combine them using logical operators (`AndAlso`, `OrElse`) to form a single, composite `Expression<Func<T, bool>>`.
4.  **Application to `IQueryable`:** The resulting `Expression<Func<T, bool>>` is passed to the `Where()` method of an `IQueryable<T>` (e.g., from Entity Framework).
5.  **Translation to Database Query:** The LINQ provider (like EF Core) receives this expression tree and translates it directly into SQL (or another query language), which is then executed by the database.

**Code Example (Simplified Dynamic Filter Builder):**

```csharp
using System.Linq.Expressions;

public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public string Category { get; set; }
    public bool InStock { get; set; }
}

public enum FilterOperator { GreaterThan, LessThan, Equal, Contains }

public class FilterCondition
{
    public string PropertyName { get; set; } // e.g., "Price", "Name", "InStock"
    public FilterOperator Operator { get; set; }
    public object Value { get; set; } // The value to compare against
}

public static class DynamicFilterBuilder
{
    public static Expression<Func<T, bool>> BuildPredicate<T>(List<FilterCondition> conditions)
    {
        if (conditions == null || !conditions.Any())
        {
            return Expression.Lambda<Func<T, bool>>(Expression.Constant(true), Expression.Parameter(typeof(T)));
        }

        ParameterExpression parameter = Expression.Parameter(typeof(T), "x");
        Expression combinedBody = null;

        foreach (var condition in conditions)
        {
            MemberExpression property = Expression.Property(parameter, condition.PropertyName);
            ConstantExpression constant = Expression.Constant(condition.Value, property.Type); // Ensure type matches property

            Expression currentConditionBody;
            switch (condition.Operator)
            {
                case FilterOperator.GreaterThan:
                    currentConditionBody = Expression.GreaterThan(property, constant);
                    break;
                case FilterOperator.LessThan:
                    currentConditionBody = Expression.LessThan(property, constant);
                    break;
                case FilterOperator.Equal:
                    currentConditionBody = Expression.Equal(property, constant);
                    break;
                case FilterOperator.Contains:
                    // For string.Contains, need to call the method
                    if (property.Type != typeof(string))
                        throw new InvalidOperationException("Contains operator only supported for string properties.");
                    MethodInfo containsMethod = typeof(string).GetMethod("Contains", new[] { typeof(string) });
                    currentConditionBody = Expression.Call(property, containsMethod, constant);
                    break;
                default:
                    throw new NotSupportedException($"Operator {condition.Operator} not supported.");
            }

            if (combinedBody == null)
            {
                combinedBody = currentConditionBody;
            }
            else
            {
                // For simplicity, combining all with AND. Could add an "And/Or" toggle in UI.
                combinedBody = Expression.AndAlso(combinedBody, currentConditionBody);
            }
        }

        return Expression.Lambda<Func<T, bool>>(combinedBody, parameter);
    }
}

public static void DynamicFilterBuilderUIExample()
{
    List<Product> products = new List<Product> // In a real app, this would be IQueryable from DB
    {
        new Product { Id = 1, Name = "Laptop Pro", Price = 1500m, Category = "Electronics", InStock = true },
        new Product { Id = 2, Name = "Gaming Mouse", Price = 75m, Category = "Electronics", InStock = true },
        new Product { Id = 3, Name = "Mechanical Keyboard", Price = 120m, Category = "Electronics", InStock = false },
        new Product { Id = 4, Name = "Desk Lamp", Price = 40m, Category = "Home Decor", InStock = true },
        new Product { Id = 5, Name = "External SSD", Price = 200m, Category = "Electronics", InStock = true }
    }.AsQueryable().ToList(); // Simulate IQueryable and ToList() for in-memory execution

    // User input from UI:
    List<FilterCondition> userFilters = new List<FilterCondition>
    {
        new FilterCondition { PropertyName = "Category", Operator = FilterOperator.Equal, Value = "Electronics" },
        new FilterCondition { PropertyName = "Price", Operator = FilterOperator.GreaterThan, Value = 100m },
        new FilterCondition { PropertyName = "InStock", Operator = FilterOperator.Equal, Value = true }
    };

    Expression<Func<Product, bool>> dynamicPredicate = DynamicFilterBuilder.BuildPredicate<Product>(userFilters);

    Console.WriteLine("Generated Predicate Expression:\n" + dynamicPredicate.ToString());

    // In a real application, this would be:
    // var filteredProducts = dbContext.Products.Where(dynamicPredicate).ToList();
    var filteredProducts = products.AsQueryable().Where(dynamicPredicate.Compile()).ToList(); // .Compile() for in-memory list

    Console.WriteLine("\nFiltered Products:");
    foreach (var p in filteredProducts)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"- {p.Name} ({p.Price:C}, {p.Category}, InStock: {p.InStock})");
    }

    /* Expected Output:
    Generated Predicate Expression:
    x => (((x.Category == "Electronics") AndAlso (x.Price > 100)) AndAlso (x.InStock == True))

    Filtered Products:
    - Laptop Pro ($1,500.00, Electronics, InStock: True)
    - External SSD ($200.00, Electronics, InStock: True)
    */
}
```

This example shows how `Expression.Parameter`, `Expression.Property`, `Expression.Constant`, and `Expression.GreaterThan` (and other binary/method call expressions) are combined to build a predicate tree from user-defined conditions. The beauty is that this tree can then be directly passed to `IQueryable` providers for database-side execution.

### You need a callback system for file processing—should you use interfaces or delegates? Justify your choice.

For a callback system, **delegates are generally the more appropriate choice**, especially for simple, single-action notifications.

**Justification for Delegates:**

1.  **Conciseness and Ergonomics:**
      * Delegates, particularly with lambda expressions, allow callers to define the callback logic inline, without needing to create a separate class just to implement the callback interface. This greatly reduces boilerplate.
      * Example: `fileProcessor.ProcessFiles(path, file => Console.WriteLine($"Processed: {file.Name}"))` is much cleaner than creating a `MyFileProcessedCallback` class.
2.  **Loose Coupling (for the callback itself):** The file processor doesn't need to know anything about the *type* of object handling the callback, only that it's a method matching the delegate signature.
3.  **Event-like Behavior:** Delegates are the foundation of C\# events, which are a very natural fit for "something happened, notify me" scenarios.
4.  **Flexibility for Multiple Subscribers:** If multiple components need to be notified of the same event (e.g., one component logs, another updates UI), you can simply add multiple delegates to the callback chain (multicast delegates).

**When an Interface Might Be Considered (and why it's less ideal for simple callbacks):**

An interface would be considered if the "callback" mechanism were more complex, involving:

  * **Multiple Related Callbacks/Behaviors:** If the processing involved notifying about different stages (e.g., `OnFileStarted`, `OnFileProgress`, `OnFileCompleted`, `OnFileError`) and these methods were tightly coupled and always implemented together. In this case, an interface like `IFileProcessingNotifier` might group them. However, even then, individual events (using delegates) are often clearer.
  * **Callback Requires State or Dependencies:** If the callback handler itself needs to manage state or inject its own dependencies (e.g., an `ILogger` for an `IFileProcessorCallback`). While technically possible, it often means the "callback" is more of a full-fledged service, in which case the interface defines the service, and its methods *might* internally use delegates for their own callbacks.

**Conclusion:** For a straightforward "something happened, call this method" scenario like file processing completion or progress, delegates (especially `Action` or `Func` variants) offer the most elegant and least verbose solution.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
public class FileProcessor
{
    // Define delegates for callbacks
    public event Action<string> OnFileProcessed; // Event for when a file is processed
    public event Action<string, Exception> OnError; // Event for errors
    public event Action<int, string> OnProgressUpdate; // Event for progress

    public void ProcessDirectory(string directoryPath)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"\n--- Processing files in {directoryPath} ---");
        var files = Directory.GetFiles(directoryPath);
        for (int i = 0; i < files.Length; i++)
        {
            string filePath = files[i];
            try
            {
                // Simulate file processing
                Console.WriteLine($"  Processing: {Path.GetFileName(filePath)}");
                // Simulate an error for demonstration
                if (Path.GetFileName(filePath).Contains("error"))
                {
                    throw new IOException("Simulated file error.");
                }

                OnFileProcessed?.Invoke(filePath); // Invoke the callback
                OnProgressUpdate?.Invoke((int)((i + 1.0) / files.Length * 100), $"Processed {i + 1} of {files.Length}");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                OnError?.Invoke(filePath, ex); // Invoke error callback
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine("--- File processing complete ---");
    }
}

public static void FileProcessingCallbackExample()
{
    FileProcessor processor = new FileProcessor();

    // Subscribe to events using lambda expressions (delegates)
    processor.OnFileProcessed += (filePath) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"    [Callback] Successfully processed: {Path.GetFileName(filePath)}");
    };

    processor.OnError += (filePath, ex) =>
    {
        Console.Error.WriteLine($"    [Callback] Error processing {Path.GetFileName(filePath)}: {ex.Message}");
    };

    processor.OnProgressUpdate += (percentage, status) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"    [Progress] {percentage}%: {status}");
    };

    // Create some dummy files
    string tempDir = "temp_files";
    if (Directory.Exists(tempDir)) Directory.Delete(tempDir, true);
    Directory.CreateDirectory(tempDir);
    File.WriteAllText(Path.Combine(tempDir, "file1.txt"), "content");
    File.WriteAllText(Path.Combine(tempDir, "file_error.txt"), "content"); // This one will cause an error
    File.WriteAllText(Path.Combine(tempDir, "file2.txt"), "content");

    processor.ProcessDirectory(tempDir);

    // Clean up
    Directory.Delete(tempDir, true);
}
```

### You're writing a rules engine—when would you use delegates vs expression trees vs interfaces?

A rules engine is an excellent example where all three can play a role, each serving a different purpose.

1.  **Delegates (for Simple, Pre-defined, or Compiled Rules):**

      * **Use Case:** When the rules are known at compile-time, are relatively simple, and you want efficient execution. Or, after an expression tree has been parsed and compiled, it becomes a delegate.
      * **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Rule: Is a customer a "Gold" customer? (known at compile-time)
        public Func<Customer, bool> IsGoldCustomer = c => c.TotalOrdersValue > 10000 && c.HasLoyaltyCard;

        // Rule: Calculate discount for an item (known at compile-time)
        public Func<Item, decimal> CalculateItemDiscount = item => item.Price * 0.1m;

        // After dynamic rule is built and compiled:
        public Func<Order, bool> DynamicDiscountEligibilityRule; // This will be assigned a compiled Expression Tree
        ```
      * **Pros:** Very fast execution once compiled. Easy to define with lambdas.
      * **Cons:** Not inspectable at runtime. Not suitable for rules defined externally (e.g., in a database) unless parsed and compiled.

2.  **Expression Trees (for Dynamic, External, and Queryable Rules):**

      * **Use Case:** When rules need to be defined by users (e.g., in a UI), loaded from a database/config file, combined dynamically, or translated into another language (like SQL).
      * **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Store rules as Expression<Func<T, bool>> in a database
        public class StoredRule
        {
            public int Id { get; set; }
            public string Name { get; set; }
            public string ExpressionString { get; set; } // e.g., "c => c.Age > 18 && c.IsActive"
        }

        // At runtime, load and parse:
        // Expression<Func<Customer, bool>> AgeAndActiveRule = ParseExpressionString(storedRule.ExpressionString);

        // Combine rules dynamically
        public Expression<Func<Customer, bool>> ComplexRule = AgeAndActiveRule.And(IsPreferredCustomerRule);

        // Apply to IQueryable for database execution
        // var eligibleCustomers = dbContext.Customers.Where(ComplexRule);
        ```
      * **Pros:** Rules can be managed externally without code changes. Can be translated to other query languages (e.g., SQL). Can be inspected and modified programmatically.
      * **Cons:** Overhead in creation and compilation. More complex to build and debug.

3.  **Interfaces (for Complex, Stateful Rules or Rule Components):**

      * **Use Case:** When a "rule" is more than just a single predicate; it involves complex logic, needs to manage state, requires its own dependencies (e.g., a service to fetch external data), or is part of a larger strategy pattern.
      * **Example:**
        ```csharp
        // Interface for a complex rule strategy
        public interface IDiscountRule
        {
            string RuleName { get; }
            bool IsApplicable(Order order); // Check if rule applies
            decimal CalculateDiscount(Order order); // Calculate discount amount
            // Perhaps other methods like bool CanBeCombinedWith(IDiscountRule otherRule);
        }

        public class NewCustomerDiscountRule : IDiscountRule
        {
            private readonly ICustomerService _customerService; // Dependency
            public NewCustomerDiscountRule(ICustomerService customerService) { _customerService = customerService; }
            public string RuleName => "New Customer Discount";
            public bool IsApplicable(Order order) => _customerService.IsNewCustomer(order.CustomerId) && order.Total > 50;
            public decimal CalculateDiscount(Order order) => order.Total * 0.15m;
        }

        // Rule Engine that executes these interfaces
        public class RuleEngine
        {
            private readonly IEnumerable<IDiscountRule> _rules;
            public RuleEngine(IEnumerable<IDiscountRule> rules) { _rules = rules; }

            public decimal ApplyDiscounts(Order order)
            {
                decimal totalDiscount = 0;
                foreach (var rule in _rules)
                {
                    if (rule.IsApplicable(order))
                    {
                        totalDiscount += rule.CalculateDiscount(order);
                    }
                }
                return totalDiscount;
            }
        }
        ```
      * **Pros:** Strong structure, enforces a contract. Excellent for dependency injection and testability. Can encapsulate complex state and dependencies.
      * **Cons:** More verbose for simple rules. Rules must be compiled into the application.

**Summary for Rules Engine:**

  * Use **Delegates** for simple, static, or already compiled execution logic.
  * Use **Expression Trees** for dynamically defining, combining, and translating rules (especially for database queries or external configuration).
  * Use **Interfaces** for complex, stateful rules that might have their own dependencies or represent a broader strategy.

### In a report generation pipeline, some logic should be user-defined—how would you represent and execute that logic?

This scenario perfectly combines `Func<T, TResult>` (as a compiled delegate) and potentially `Expression<Func<T, TResult>>` (for complex, queryable logic) with a robust interface for the overall pipeline.

**Representing and Executing User-Defined Logic:**

1.  **Simple Transformations/Calculations (Delegates `Func<TInput, TOutput>`):**

      * **Representation:** For relatively simple calculations or data formatting (e.g., "format date as MM/DD/YYYY", "calculate profit margin"), expose properties or parameters that accept `Func<TInput, TOutput>`.
      * **Execution:** Directly invoke the `Func` within your pipeline step.
      * **User Input:** The UI would need to provide a way for users to define these simple functions. This might be a textbox where they type a simple formula that you then parse and compile into a `Func` using `Expression.Lambda().Compile()`.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public class ReportRow
    {
        public decimal Revenue { get; set; }
        public decimal Costs { get; set; }
        public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
        public string ProductName { get; set; }
    }

    public class ReportStepConfig
    {
        // User defines how to calculate a 'Metric' column
        public Func<ReportRow, decimal> MetricCalculator { get; set; }

        // User defines how to format a 'Date' column
        public Func<DateTime, string> DateFormatter { get; set; }

        // ... other config ...
    }

    public class TransformationStep
    {
        public IEnumerable<string> Transform(IEnumerable<ReportRow> data, ReportStepConfig config)
        {
            foreach (var row in data)
            {
                decimal customMetric = config.MetricCalculator(row); // Execute user-defined logic
                string formattedDate = config.DateFormatter(row.OrderDate); // Execute user-defined logic
                yield return $"{row.ProductName} | {formattedDate} | {customMetric:C}";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Complex Filtering/Sorting/Aggregations (Expression Trees `Expression<Func<TInput, bool>>`, `Expression<Func<TInput, TKey>>`):**

      * **Representation:** When the user wants to define complex filters (e.g., "only show products with revenue \> $500 AND costs \< $100"), or define custom sorting keys that need to be pushed down to a database query.
      * **Execution:** The `Expression<Func<...>>` is passed directly to LINQ methods on `IQueryable<T>`. The LINQ provider handles the translation and execution.
      * **User Input:** The UI would provide a structured way for users to build these queries (like the dynamic filter builder example above), which you'd then translate into `Expression` objects.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public class ReportQueryConfig
    {
        public Expression<Func<ReportRow, bool>> FilterPredicate { get; set; }
        public Expression<Func<ReportRow, object>> OrderBySelector { get; set; } // for dynamic OrderBy
        public bool OrderByAscending { get; set; }
    }

    public class DataQueryStep
    {
        private IQueryable<ReportRow> _dataSource; // From EF DbContext or similar

        public DataQueryStep(IQueryable<ReportRow> dataSource) { _dataSource = dataSource; }

        public IEnumerable<ReportRow> GetData(ReportQueryConfig config)
        {
            var query = _dataSource;

            if (config.FilterPredicate != null)
            {
                query = query.Where(config.FilterPredicate); // Passed to IQueryable
            }

            if (config.OrderBySelector != null)
            {
                query = config.OrderByAscending
                    ? query.OrderBy(config.OrderBySelector)
                    : query.OrderByDescending(config.OrderBySelector);
            }

            return query.ToList(); // Execution happens here (translated to SQL)
        }
    }
    ```

3.  **Overall Pipeline Structure (Interfaces):**

      * The overall pipeline (e.g., `IDataSourceProvider`, `IDataTransformer`, `IReportRenderer`) would still be defined by interfaces. Each user-defined piece of logic slots into one of these stages, usually exposed as properties or parameters accepting delegates or expression trees.

**In summary:** Delegates for simple, in-memory transformations. Expression trees for complex, queryable logic that needs to be pushed to a data source. Interfaces to define the overarching structure of the pipeline components.

### You need to inspect and transform code at runtime—why wouldn’t you use a delegate? Why is an expression tree more appropriate?

This highlights the core difference between the two: a delegate is **compiled executable code**, while an expression tree is **data that represents code**.

**Why you wouldn't use a Delegate to inspect and transform code at runtime:**

  * **Delegates are Compiled (Black Box):** Once a method (or a lambda compiled into a delegate) is compiled, its underlying IL (Intermediate Language) code is like a black box. You cannot easily:
      * **Inspect its structure:** You can't ask a delegate, "Does this method contain a call to `Console.WriteLine`?" or "What properties does it access?". You can only *execute* it.
      * **Modify its logic:** You cannot change the behavior of a compiled delegate without recompiling the entire assembly.
      * **Translate it:** You cannot easily convert the IL of a delegate into another language like SQL or a web service call.

**Why an Expression Tree is more appropriate for inspecting and transforming code:**

  * **Code as Data (White Box):** An expression tree represents code as a hierarchical data structure (a tree of `Expression` objects like `ConstantExpression`, `ParameterExpression`, `MethodCallExpression`, `BinaryExpression`, etc.).
  * **Inspectability (Reflection on Code Structure):** You can traverse the nodes of an expression tree, examine their types, their arguments, and their relationships. This is akin to performing reflection *on the code itself*.
      * **Example:** You can find all `MemberAccessExpression` nodes to see which properties are being read, or all `MethodCallExpression` nodes to see which methods are being invoked.
  * **Modifiability (Rewriting Trees):** You can use an `ExpressionVisitor` to traverse an expression tree, modify specific nodes, and then create a new, modified expression tree.
      * **Example:** You might replace all calls to `string.ToUpper()` with `string.ToLower()`, or inject security checks around certain method calls.
  * **Translatability:** Since the code is represented as data, it can be interpreted and translated by an external engine. This is precisely what LINQ providers do: they translate C\# expression trees into SQL, GraphQL, or other query languages.
  * **Dynamic Code Generation:** You can programmatically construct an expression tree from scratch, representing arbitrary code logic, and then compile it into a `Func` or `Action` delegate using `.Compile()`. This allows you to generate and execute code at runtime based on external input.

**Example Illustrating Inspection and Transformation:**

```csharp
using System.Linq.Expressions;

public class Employee
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public decimal Salary { get; set; }
}

This example shows how `ExpressionVisitor` can be used to both inspect (find accessed properties) and transform (change `Contains` to `StartsWith`) the structure of an expression tree. This is fundamentally impossible with a simple delegate because a delegate is compiled code, not an inspectable data structure.
