Let's break down pattern matching in C\#, its evolution, and its advantages over traditional control flow.

### 1\. How is pattern matching different from traditional `if-else` or `switch` statements?

Pattern matching in C\# is a powerful feature that allows you to test an expression against various patterns and, depending on whether the expression matches a pattern, execute different code paths. It goes beyond simple equality checks or type checks, enabling more expressive and concise conditional logic.

Here's how it differs from traditional `if-else` or `switch` statements:

1.  **Beyond Equality/Enum Values:**

      * **Traditional `switch`:** Primarily works on equality of primitive types (like `int`, `string`, `char`), `enum` values, or the `Type` of an object. It's limited to direct matches.
      * **Traditional `if-else`:** Allows for complex boolean conditions, but often becomes verbose when dealing with multiple types, ranges, or nested conditions.
      * **Pattern Matching:** Extends `switch` and `if` to handle:
          * **Types:** Check an object's type and cast it simultaneously.
          * **Properties:** Inspect values of properties within an object.
          * **Relational operators:** Check if a value falls within a range (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
          * **Logical combinations:** Combine multiple patterns using `and`, `or`, `not`.
          * **Null checks:** Integrate null checks directly into patterns.

2.  **Deconstruction and Variable Declaration:**

      * **Traditional `if-else` (with type checking):** Often requires a separate `is` check followed by an explicit cast (`if (obj is MyType) { MyType myVar = (MyType)obj; ... }`).
      * **Pattern Matching:** Allows you to test the type and simultaneously declare a new variable of that type in a single step (e.g., `if (obj is MyType myVar)`). This is called "type-testing and casting in one go" or "flow-sensitive typing."

3.  **Expressiveness and Readability:**

      * Pattern matching makes complex conditional logic more concise and readable, especially when dealing with object hierarchies or multiple criteria. It often reduces nesting and repetition.
      * It shifts the focus from "how to get the value out" (casting) to "what shape the data has" (pattern matching).

4.  **Exhaustiveness Checking (for `switch` expressions/statements):**

      * **Traditional `switch`:** Does not enforce exhaustiveness checking for all possible cases, which can lead to runtime bugs if a new enum member is added and not handled.
      * **Pattern Matching `switch` expressions:** Can provide compile-time warnings or errors if not all possible patterns are covered, especially for sealed class hierarchies or enums, promoting more robust code.

5.  **New Syntax (`switch` expression):**

      * C\# 8.0 introduced the `switch` expression, a more functional approach to `switch` that allows it to return a value directly, eliminating the need for break statements and reducing boilerplate. This is a significant departure from the traditional `switch` statement.

**Analogy:**
Think of traditional `if-else`/`switch` as a simple filter that looks for exact matches or basic truth. Pattern matching is like an advanced scanner that can identify complex structures, extract specific details, and then route the data based on those insights.

### 2\. What are the different types of patterns supported in C\#?

C\# has evolved to support a rich set of patterns. Here are the main types, including their C\# version introduction:

#### 2.1. Constant Pattern (C\# 7.0)

  * **Syntax:** `const_expression`
  * **Purpose:** Tests if an expression's result is equal to a specified constant value.
  * **Examples:**
      * `case 5:` (checks if value is 5)
      * `case "admin":` (checks if string is "admin")
      * `case null:` (checks if value is null)

#### 2.2. Type Pattern (C\# 7.0)

  * **Syntax:** `type_name [variable_name]`
  * **Purpose:** Tests if an expression's result is compatible with a given type. If it is, it can optionally declare a new variable of that type, making it available in the matched block.
  * **Examples:**
      * `case int i:` (tests if `obj` is an `int`, and if so, declares `i` as that `int` value)
      * `case string s:` (tests if `obj` is a `string`, and declares `s`)
      * `case IDisposable d:` (tests if `obj` implements `IDisposable`, and declares `d`)

#### 2.3. Relational Pattern (C\# 9.0)

  * **Syntax:** `< | > | <= | >= const_expression`
  * **Purpose:** Tests if an expression's result is less than, greater than, less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to a specified constant.
  * **Examples:**
      * `case < 0:` (checks if value is negative)
      * `case >= 100:` (checks if value is 100 or more)
      * `case > 0 and < 10:` (combined with logical pattern, checks for range)

#### 2.4. Logical Patterns (`and`, `or`, `not`) (C\# 9.0)

  * **Syntax:** `pattern1 and pattern2`, `pattern1 or pattern2`, `not pattern`
  * **Purpose:** Combines multiple patterns using logical operators.
  * **Examples:**
      * `case int i and > 0:` (type is `int` AND value is greater than 0)
      * `case "admin" or "moderator":` (value is "admin" OR "moderator")
      * `case not null:` (value is NOT null)
      * `case not (>= 0 and < 100):` (value is NOT in the range [0, 100))

#### 2.5. Property Pattern (C\# 8.0)

  * **Syntax:** `{ PropertyName: pattern, AnotherProperty: pattern, ... }`
  * **Purpose:** Tests an expression's properties or fields against nested patterns. This is powerful for inspecting the internal state of objects.
  * **Examples:**
      * `case { IsActive: true }:` (checks if `IsActive` property is true)
      * `case { UserRole: "Admin", IsLoggedIn: true }:` (checks multiple properties)
      * `case { Address: { City: "New York" } }:` (nested property pattern)

#### 2.6. Var Pattern (C\# 7.0)

  * **Syntax:** `var variable_name`
  * **Purpose:** Always matches, and captures the value of the expression into a new variable. Useful as a "wildcard" or for capturing the value in a `switch` statement.
  * **Example:**
      * `case var x:` (matches anything, and `x` will hold the value)

#### 2.7. Positional Pattern (C\# 8.0)

  * **Syntax:** `TypeName(pattern1, pattern2, ...)`
  * **Purpose:** Deconstructs an object into its components (requires a `Deconstruct` method) and then applies patterns to those components.
  * **Example:**
      * `case Point(0, 0):` (deconstructs `Point` to X and Y, checks if both are 0)
      * `case Person(string firstName, _):` (deconstructs `Person` and captures `firstName`)

#### 2.8. Parenthesized Pattern (C\# 9.0)

  * **Syntax:** `(pattern)`
  * **Purpose:** Used to change precedence or group patterns within logical patterns.
  * **Example:**
      * `case (true or false) and (x > 10):`

#### 2.9. Discard Pattern (C\# 8.0)

  * **Syntax:** `_`
  * **Purpose:** Matches any value, but does not bind it to a variable. Useful for ignoring values in positional patterns or as a catch-all in `switch` statements.
  * **Example:**
      * `case Person(_, "Smith"):` (match any first name, last name "Smith")
      * ` case _:  ` (matches anything, often the default case in a `switch` expression)

#### 2.10. List Patterns (C\# 11)

  * **Syntax:** `[pattern1, pattern2, ..., patternN]` or `[pattern1, ..., patternN]`
  * **Purpose:** Matches elements within sequences (arrays, lists, spans) and applies patterns to them.
  * **Examples:**
      * `case [1, 2, 3]:` (matches an array/list with elements 1, 2, 3)
      * `case [var first, ..]:` (matches any list and captures the first element)
      * `case [_, 2, ..]:` (matches a list whose second element is 2)

#### 2.11. Extended Property Patterns (C\# 10)

  * **Purpose:** Allows properties of an object to be directly accessed and pattern-matched without explicitly writing the object name. This is implicitly used in nested property patterns.

### 3\. Can pattern matching be used with null checks?

**Yes, absolutely\!** Pattern matching provides elegant and concise ways to handle null checks.

1.  **Constant Pattern with `null`:** This is the most direct way.

    ```csharp
    object myObject = GetSomeObject();

    if (myObject is null) // Constant pattern in an 'is' expression
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Object is null.");
    }

    // In a switch statement/expression:
    string result = myObject switch
    {
        null => "Input was null.",
        string s => $"Input was string: {s}",
        _ => "Input was something else."
    };
    ```

2.  **Logical Pattern with `not null` (C\# 9.0+):** This explicitly checks for non-null values.

    ```csharp
    if (myObject is not null) // Logical NOT pattern
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Object is not null.");
    }

    if (myObject is string s and not null) // Combines type check and null check
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Non-null string: {s}");
    }
    ```

Pattern matching significantly simplifies code that previously required separate `if (obj != null)` checks followed by type checks.

### 4\. What is a type guard in pattern matching?

A "type guard" (or sometimes "type test pattern" or "flow-sensitive typing") refers to the ability of pattern matching to **test the type of an expression and, if successful, create a new variable of that specific type (and scope it to the matched block) without requiring an explicit cast.**

This is a core feature of the **type pattern**.

**Example:**

```csharp
public void ProcessShape(object shape)
{
    // Traditional way:
    if (shape is Circle)
    {
        Circle circle = (Circle)shape; // Explicit cast needed
        circle.Radius = 5;
    }

    // Using type guard (C# 7.0+):
    if (shape is Circle circle) // 'circle' is the type guard variable
    {
        // 'circle' is automatically of type Circle and safely cast within this block
        circle.Radius = 5;
        Console.WriteLine($"Processed a circle with radius {circle.Radius}");
    }
    else if (shape is Rectangle rect) // 'rect' is the type guard variable
    {
        rect.Width = 10;
        rect.Height = 20;
        Console.WriteLine($"Processed a rectangle with dimensions {rect.Width}x{rect.Height}");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Unknown shape.");
    }
}
```

In the `if (shape is Circle circle)` pattern:

  * `shape is Circle`: This part tests if `shape` is compatible with the `Circle` type.
  * `circle`: This part declares a new local variable named `circle` of type `Circle`. If the type test passes, the value of `shape` is safely cast and assigned to `circle`.
  * The scope of `circle` is limited to the `if` block, ensuring type safety.

Type guards make code cleaner, more readable, and reduce the risk of `InvalidCastException` because the compiler guarantees the type safety within the scope where the variable is available.

### 8\. Explain when to use `is` vs `switch` in pattern matching.

Both the `is` expression (in an `if` statement) and the `switch` statement/expression leverage pattern matching, but they are suited for different scenarios.

#### When to use `is` (expression in `if` statement):

Use `is` when you need to perform a **single, specific check or a small number of sequential checks** against an expression, typically involving:

1.  **Simple Type Checking and Casting:**

    ```csharp
    if (obj is string s)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"It's a string: {s.Length}");
    }
    ```

2.  **Null Checks (since C\# 7.0):**

    ```csharp
    if (name is null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Name is null.");
    }
    else if (name is not "Admin") // C# 9+
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Name is not Admin.");
    }
    ```

3.  **Simple Property Checks (C\# 8.0+):**

    ```csharp
    if (person is { Age: > 18 }) // C# 8+ property pattern
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Adult person.");
    }
    ```

4.  **Early Exit Conditions:** When a condition means you can immediately return or stop processing.

    ```csharp
    if (data is null) return; // Exit early if null
    if (data is ErrorPayload error) { LogError(error); return; } // Handle specific error and exit
    ```

5.  **Small Number of Distinct Cases:** When there are only one or two alternative conditions.

#### When to use `switch` (statement or expression):

Use `switch` (especially the `switch` expression) when you need to perform **multiple, mutually exclusive checks** against an expression, and often want to return a value or execute different blocks of code based on the *shape* or *characteristics* of the input.

**`switch` statement (traditional, enhanced with patterns):**

  * **Multiple Cases of Different Types:**

    ```csharp
    void ProcessInput(object input)
    {
        switch (input)
        {
            case int i:
                Console.WriteLine($"Integer: {i}");
                break;
            case string s:
                Console.WriteLine($"String: {s}");
                break;
            case decimal d when d > 100m: // Type pattern with a 'when' clause
                Console.WriteLine($"Large decimal: {d}");
                break;
            case null:
                Console.WriteLine("Input is null.");
                break;
            default: // Catch-all
                Console.WriteLine("Unknown type.");
                break;
        }
    }
    ```

  * **Handling Enum Values with Exhaustiveness:**

    ```csharp
    switch (day)
    {
        case DayOfWeek.Saturday:
        case DayOfWeek.Sunday:
            Console.WriteLine("Weekend!");
            break;
        case DayOfWeek.Monday:
        case DayOfWeek.Tuesday:
        case DayOfWeek.Wednesday:
        case DayOfWeek.Thursday:
        case DayOfWeek.Friday:
            Console.WriteLine("Weekday.");
            break;
    }
    ```

**`switch` expression (C\# 8.0+, more functional):**

  * **Returning a Value Based on Pattern:** Ideal for mapping inputs to outputs.

    ```csharp
    string GetFee(object vehicle) => vehicle switch
    {
        Car c when c.HasFastPass => "$2.00",
        Car _ => "$3.00",
        Truck t when t.Weight > 5000 => "$10.00",
        Truck _ => "$5.00",
        null => throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(vehicle)),
        _ => "Unknown vehicle type" // Discard pattern as catch-all
    };
    ```

  * **Exhaustiveness Checking:** The compiler can warn if not all possible enum values or sealed class types are covered, enhancing robustness.

  * **Conciseness:** Eliminates `break` statements and reduces boilerplate compared to `switch` statements.

**General Guideline:**

  * **`is` for simple, binary choices (yes/no, is this type/not this type) or an early exit.**
  * **`switch` for multi-way branching based on different structures, values, or combinations of properties, especially when you need to return a value or cover many distinct cases.**

Pattern matching, whether with `is` or `switch`, aims to make your code more readable, maintainable, and type-safe by allowing you to express complex conditional logic more naturally.
