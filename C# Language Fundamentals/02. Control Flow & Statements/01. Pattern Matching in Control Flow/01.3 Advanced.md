Let's continue our exploration of C\# pattern matching, focusing on more advanced features and practical applications.

### 1\. Explain property pattern matching and give an example.

**Property pattern matching** (introduced in C\# 8.0) allows you to test an expression's properties or fields against nested patterns. Instead of just checking the type of an object, you can directly inspect its internal state (values of its properties or accessible fields) as part of the pattern matching process.

It enables you to ask questions like: "Is this object a `Person` AND does that `Person` have an `Age` greater than 18 AND is their `City` 'New York'?"

**Syntax:**

The basic syntax is `{ PropertyName: pattern, AnotherProperty: pattern, ... }`

**How it works:**

1.  The compiler first attempts to cast the input expression to the type that contains the specified properties.
2.  If the cast is successful, it then checks if the values of the specified properties (or accessible fields) match the nested patterns.
3.  You can nest property patterns as deeply as needed.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a `Person` class:

```csharp
public class Address
{
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }
}

public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public Address HomeAddress { get; set; }
    public bool IsEmployed { get; set; }
}
```

Now, using property pattern matching:

```csharp
public static string GetPersonCategory(Person person)
{
    return person switch
    {
        // 1. Check if person is null (constant pattern)
        null => "Not a person (null)",

        // 2. Person is employed and is 65 or older
        { IsEmployed: true, Age: >= 65 } => "Retired Employee",

        // 3. Person is employed and between 18 and 64, and lives in USA
        { IsEmployed: true, Age: >= 18 and < 65, HomeAddress: { Country: "USA" } } => "Working Adult (USA)",

        // 4. Person is not employed, 18 or older, and lives in a specific city
        { IsEmployed: false, Age: >= 18, HomeAddress: { City: "London" } } => "Unemployed Adult (London)",

        // 5. Person is not employed and under 18
        { IsEmployed: false, Age: < 18 } => "Unemployed Minor",

        // 6. Catch-all for any other Person instance
        _ => "Other Person Category"
    };
}

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Person p1 = new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 67, IsEmployed = true, HomeAddress = new Address { Country = "USA", City = "Seattle" } };
    Person p2 = new Person { Name = "Bob", Age = 30, IsEmployed = true, HomeAddress = new Address { Country = "USA", City = "Austin" } };
    Person p3 = new Person { Name = "Charlie", Age = 20, IsEmployed = false, HomeAddress = new Address { Country = "UK", City = "London" } };
    Person p4 = new Person { Name = "David", Age = 16, IsEmployed = false, HomeAddress = new Address { Country = "Canada", City = "Toronto" } };
    Person p5 = new Person { Name = "Eve", Age = 45, IsEmployed = true, HomeAddress = new Address { Country = "Germany", City = "Berlin" } };

    Console.WriteLine($"{p1.Name}: {GetPersonCategory(p1)}"); // Alice: Retired Employee
    Console.WriteLine($"{p2.Name}: {GetPersonCategory(p2)}"); // Bob: Working Adult (USA)
    Console.WriteLine($"{p3.Name}: {GetPersonCategory(p3)}"); // Charlie: Unemployed Adult (London)
    Console.WriteLine($"{p4.Name}: {GetPersonCategory(p4)}"); // David: Unemployed Minor
    Console.WriteLine($"{p5.Name}: {GetPersonCategory(p5)}"); // Eve: Other Person Category
    Console.WriteLine($"Null: {GetPersonCategory(null)}");     // Null: Not a person (null)
}
```

This example demonstrates how property patterns allow you to elegantly express complex conditions based on an object's state, including nested objects, making the code much more readable and concise than a series of nested `if-else` statements.

### 2\. How do `not`, `and`, and `or` logical patterns work in C\# 9+?

C\# 9.0 introduced logical patterns, allowing you to combine other patterns using the `not`, `and`, and `or` keywords, making your pattern matching expressions even more powerful and flexible.

These patterns are evaluated based on Boolean logic.

1.  **`not` pattern:**

      * **Syntax:** `not pattern`
      * **Purpose:** Matches when the inner pattern *does not* match. It negates the result of the pattern that follows it.
      * **Example:**
        ```csharp
        object value = 10;
        if (value is not null) // Matches if value is not null
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Value is not null.");
        }

        string status = "Approved";
        if (status is not ("Pending" or "Rejected")) // Matches if status is neither "Pending" nor "Rejected"
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Status is good.");
        }
        ```

2.  **`and` pattern:**

      * **Syntax:** `pattern1 and pattern2`
      * **Purpose:** Matches when *both* `pattern1` and `pattern2` match the expression. This is equivalent to a logical AND.
      * **Example:**
        ```csharp
        int score = 75;
        if (score is > 60 and < 80) // Matches if score is greater than 60 AND less than 80
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Score is in the B range.");
        }

        Person p = new Person { Age = 30, IsEmployed = true };
        if (p is { Age: > 18 } and { IsEmployed: true }) // Matches if Age > 18 AND IsEmployed is true
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Adult and employed.");
        }
        ```
      * **Note on Precedence:** `and` has higher precedence than `or`. `A or B and C` is `A or (B and C)`. Use parentheses `()` to change this, e.g., `(A or B) and C`.

3.  **`or` pattern:**

      * **Syntax:** `pattern1 or pattern2`
      * **Purpose:** Matches when *either* `pattern1` or `pattern2` (or both) match the expression. This is equivalent to a logical OR.
      * **Example:**
        ```csharp
        int day = (int)DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek;
        if (day is 0 or 6) // Matches if day is Sunday (0) OR Saturday (6)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("It's a weekend day.");
        }

        string userRole = "Admin";
        if (userRole is "Admin" or "SuperUser") // Matches if role is "Admin" OR "SuperUser"
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Elevated privileges.");
        }
        ```

These logical patterns significantly increase the expressiveness and readability of complex conditional logic within `if`, `switch` expressions, and `switch` statements.

### 3\. Can pattern matching be used inside a `when` clause in exception handling? How?

**Yes, absolutely\!** You can use pattern matching inside a `when` clause of a `catch` block in C\#. This allows you to catch an exception of a certain type, but then only handle it if it matches an additional pattern.

The `when` clause acts as an additional filter that must evaluate to `true` for the `catch` block to execute.

**How it works:**

You place the pattern matching expression after the `when` keyword, following the exception type declaration.

**Example:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

public class MyCustomException : Exception
{
    public int ErrorCode { get; }
    public MyCustomException(string message, int errorCode) : base(message)
    {
        ErrorCode = errorCode;
    }
}

public class ExceptionHandlingWithPatterns
{
    public static void SimulateOperation(int scenario)
    {
        if (scenario == 1)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException("Value cannot be null.", "paramName");
        }
        else if (scenario == 2)
        {
            throw new MyCustomException("Database connection failed.", 500);
        }
        else if (scenario == 3)
        {
            throw new MyCustomException("File not found in specific path.", 404);
        }
        else if (scenario == 4)
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Operation not allowed in current state.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Operation completed successfully.");
        }
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++)
        {
            try
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"\n--- Simulating scenario {i} ---");
                SimulateOperation(i);
            }
            // Catch ArgumentNullException and check its ParamName property
            catch (ArgumentNullException ex when ex.ParamName == "paramName")
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Caught specific ArgumentNullException: {ex.Message}");
            }
            // Catch MyCustomException and check its ErrorCode property (relational pattern)
            catch (MyCustomException ex when ex.ErrorCode >= 500)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Caught MyCustomException with server error code: {ex.ErrorCode} - {ex.Message}");
            }
            // Catch MyCustomException and check its ErrorCode property (constant pattern)
            catch (MyCustomException ex when ex.ErrorCode == 404)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Caught MyCustomException (404 Not Found): {ex.Message}");
            }
            // Catch any InvalidOperationException
            catch (InvalidOperationException ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Caught general InvalidOperationException: {ex.Message}");
            }
            // Catch any other exception as a fallback
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Caught unexpected exception: {ex.GetType().Name} - {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
--- Simulating scenario 1 ---
Caught specific ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'paramName')

--- Simulating scenario 2 ---
Caught MyCustomException with server error code: 500 - Database connection failed.

--- Simulating scenario 3 ---
Caught MyCustomException (404 Not Found): File not found in specific path.

--- Simulating scenario 4 ---
Caught general InvalidOperationException: Operation not allowed in current state.
```

This feature is incredibly useful for:

  * Handling specific sub-types of an exception.
  * Distinguishing exceptions based on internal properties (like an `ErrorCode`, `HResult`, or a custom flag).
  * Creating more granular and precise error handling logic without resorting to nested `if` statements inside `catch` blocks.

### 4\. How does pattern matching affect performance compared to polymorphism?

This is a subtle but important distinction. Pattern matching and polymorphism serve different purposes and have different performance characteristics:

1.  **Polymorphism (Dynamic Dispatch):**

      * **Mechanism:** Achieved through virtual methods or abstract methods. The actual method to be called is determined at **runtime** based on the *actual type* of the object, not its declared type. This lookup is done via the object's virtual method table (VMT).
      * **Performance:** Generally very fast. The VMT lookup is a well-optimized, constant-time operation ($O(1)$) on modern CPUs, as it's a direct table lookup.
      * **Best Use Case:** When you have a set of related objects (an inheritance hierarchy) that share a common behavior (defined by an interface or base class) but implement that behavior differently. Polymorphism encourages extensible designs where you can add new types without modifying existing code (Open/Closed Principle).
      * **"Behavior-first" approach:** You ask "what can this object *do*?"

2.  **Pattern Matching:**

      * **Mechanism:** Involves checks (type checks, property checks, etc.) performed at **runtime**.
      * **Performance:**
          * **`is` expression (single check):** Relatively fast. The underlying IL might involve `isinst` (type check) and `castclass` (cast) instructions, which are efficient.
          * **`switch` expression/statement (multiple cases):** The compiler translates patterns into a series of `if-else` `is` checks, `cast` operations, and potentially branch tables or dictionary lookups for complex string/enum matching. The performance depends on the complexity and order of patterns. For simple type/constant patterns, it can be very efficient. For complex nested property patterns, it will involve more checks.
          * **Hashing vs. `is` checks:** For `switch` on `int` or `string` *values*, the compiler might use hash tables or jump tables (like traditional `switch`), which are highly optimized. For *type patterns*, it uses `is` checks.
      * **Best Use Case:** When you need to branch logic based on the *structure* or *data* of an object, rather than just its polymorphic behavior. It's often used when the branching logic is external to the object itself (e.g., in a utility method, a parser, or a visitor pattern implementation).
      * **"Data-first" approach:** You ask "what *is* this object, and what are its properties?"

**Comparison Summary:**

  * **Polymorphism:** Preferred when behavior varies by type. It's about *what* an object does. Very high performance for method dispatch.
  * **Pattern Matching:** Preferred when data structure/state dictates control flow. It's about *what* an object *is* (its shape and values). Performance is generally good but can vary with complexity; for simple type checks, it's comparable to direct casts, for complex patterns, it's an optimized series of checks.

**When to choose:**

  * If you're defining a behavior that is intrinsic to a type hierarchy and needs to be overridden, use **polymorphism**.
  * If you're writing a utility function or a processing logic that needs to analyze the *shape* or *specific values* of incoming objects (which might come from various sources or types), then **pattern matching** provides a clean and readable way to do so.

You're not necessarily choosing one *over* the other in all cases; they often complement each other. Pattern matching can sometimes replace verbose `if/else if` chains that mimic polymorphism but lack its extensibility.

### 5\. How do you handle pattern matching with inheritance and interfaces?

Pattern matching handles inheritance and interfaces very elegantly, making it powerful for working with object hierarchies.

**1. With Inheritance (Type Patterns):**

Type patterns naturally work with inheritance. When you test for a base class or interface, derived classes will also match. Order matters in `switch` statements/expressions. More specific types should generally come before more general types.

```csharp
public class Animal { public string Name { get; set; } }
public class Dog : Animal { public string Breed { get; set; } }
public class Cat : Animal { public bool HasClaws { get; set; } }

public static string DescribeAnimal(Animal animal)
{
    return animal switch
    {
        Dog dog => $"Dog: {dog.Name}, Breed: {dog.Breed}", // Specific: Dog
        Cat cat when cat.HasClaws => $"Cat: {cat.Name} (with claws)", // Specific: Cat with condition
        Cat cat => $"Cat: {cat.Name} (no claws)", // Specific: Cat
        Animal a => $"Generic Animal: {a.Name}", // General: Any other Animal (including other derived types)
        null => "No animal provided." // Null check
    };
}

public static void Main()
{
    Console.WriteLine(DescribeAnimal(new Dog { Name = "Buddy", Breed = "Golden Retriever" }));
    Console.WriteLine(DescribeAnimal(new Cat { Name = "Whiskers", HasClaws = true }));
    Console.WriteLine(DescribeAnimal(new Cat { Name = "Mittens", HasClaws = false }));
    Console.WriteLine(DescribeAnimal(new Animal { Name = "Unknown" }));
    Console.WriteLine(DescribeAnimal(null));
}
```

**Output:**

```
Dog: Buddy, Breed: Golden Retriever
Cat: Whiskers (with claws)
Cat: Mittens (no claws)
Generic Animal: Unknown
No animal provided.
```

In `switch` expressions/statements, the first matching pattern is executed. So, if `Dog` comes before `Animal`, it will correctly match `Dog` instances first. If `Animal a` came before `Dog dog`, it would always match `Animal` for dogs, which would be incorrect.

**2. With Interfaces (Type Patterns):**

You can also match against interfaces. If an object implements the interface, the pattern will match, and you can access interface members through the declared variable.

```csharp
public interface IShape { double Area(); }
public class Circle : IShape { public double Radius { get; set; } public double Area() => Math.PI * Radius * Radius; }
public class Square : IShape { public double Side { get; set; } public double Area() => Side * Side; }

public static string GetShapeInfo(object shape)
{
    return shape switch
    {
        IShape s => $"Shape area: {s.Area()}", // Matches if shape implements IShape
        string message => $"This is a message: {message}",
        _ => "Not a recognized shape or message."
    };
}

public static void Main()
{
    Console.WriteLine(GetShapeInfo(new Circle { Radius = 5 })); // Shape area: 78.53981633974483
    Console.WriteLine(GetShapeInfo(new Square { Side = 4 }));   // Shape area: 16
    Console.WriteLine(GetShapeInfo("Hello world"));             // This is a message: Hello world
    Console.WriteLine(GetShapeInfo(123));                       // Not a recognized shape or message.
}
```

This demonstrates how pattern matching makes it easy to branch logic based on an object's type, whether it's a concrete class in an inheritance hierarchy or an implementation of a specific interface.

### 6\. Can you use pattern matching in LINQ queries? If so, how?

**Yes, you can absolutely use pattern matching in LINQ queries\!** This feature, particularly the `is` operator and property patterns, makes LINQ queries much more powerful and expressive for filtering and projecting collections of mixed types or objects based on their internal state.

The most common places to use pattern matching in LINQ queries are within:

1.  **`where` clause:** To filter elements based on their type or property values.
2.  **`select` clause:** To project new objects or values based on patterns.
3.  **`orderby` clause:** Less common, but possible for ordering based on patterned properties.

**Example:**

Let's use the `Person`, `Address`, `Animal`, `Dog`, `Cat`, `IShape`, `Circle`, `Square` classes from previous examples.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class LinqPatternMatchingDemo
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<object> mixedItems = new List<object>
        {
            new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 30, IsEmployed = true, HomeAddress = new Address { City = "Seattle", Country = "USA" } },
            new Person { Name = "Bob", Age = 15, IsEmployed = false, HomeAddress = new Address { City = "London", Country = "UK" } },
            new Dog { Name = "Fido", Breed = "Labrador" },
            new Cat { Name = "Mittens", HasClaws = true },
            new Person { Name = "Charlie", Age = 45, IsEmployed = true, HomeAddress = new Address { City = "New York", Country = "USA" } },
            new Circle { Radius = 10 },
            "Hello World",
            null,
            new Square { Side = 5 },
            new Dog { Name = "Rex", Breed = "German Shepherd" }
        };

        // 1. Filtering using type pattern in 'where'
        var adults = mixedItems.OfType<Person>() // Filter to only Person objects first (optional, but good practice)
                               .Where(p => p is { Age: >= 18 }); // Pattern matching: Person with Age >= 18
        Console.WriteLine("Adults:");
        foreach (var p in adults)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"- {p.Name} ({p.Age})");
        }
        // Output:
        // - Alice (30)
        // - Charlie (45)

        Console.WriteLine("\nAnimals that are Dogs:");
        // 2. Filtering using type pattern and property pattern in 'where'
        var onlyDogs = mixedItems.Where(item => item is Dog { Breed: "Labrador" }); // Pattern matching: Is a Dog AND Breed is "Labrador"
        foreach (Dog dog in onlyDogs) // Cast to Dog because the filter guarantees it
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"- {dog.Name} ({dog.Breed})");
        }
        // Output:
        // - Fido (Labrador)


        Console.WriteLine("\nShapes with Area > 50:");
        // 3. Filtering using interface type pattern and calling method in 'where' clause
        var largeShapes = mixedItems.Where(item => item is IShape s && s.Area() > 50); // Pattern matching: Is IShape AND Area > 50
        foreach (IShape shape in largeShapes)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"- Area: {shape.Area()} (Type: {shape.GetType().Name})");
        }
        // Output:
        // - Area: 314.1592653589793 (Type: Circle)


        Console.WriteLine("\nProjecting based on type and value (using select and switch expression):");
        // 4. Projecting using a switch expression with various patterns in 'select'
        var itemCategories = mixedItems.Select(item => item switch
        {
            Person p when p.IsEmployed => $"Employed Person: {p.Name}",
            Person p => $"Unemployed Person: {p.Name}",
            Dog d => $"Canine: {d.Name}",
            Cat c => $"Feline: {c.Name}",
            IShape s => $"Geometric Shape (Area: {s.Area():F2})",
            string text => $"Text: '{text.Substring(0, Math.Min(text.Length, 10))}...'",
            null => "Null Item",
            _ => "Miscellaneous Item"
        });

        foreach (var category in itemCategories)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(category);
        }
        // Output:
        // Employed Person: Alice
        // Unemployed Person: Bob
        // Canine: Fido
        // Feline: Mittens
        // Employed Person: Charlie
        // Geometric Shape (Area: 314.16)
        // Text: 'Hello Worl...'
        // Null Item
        // Geometric Shape (Area: 25.00)
        // Canine: Rex
    }
}
```

As you can see, pattern matching significantly enhances the expressiveness and readability of LINQ queries, especially when dealing with polymorphic collections or objects whose filtering/projection logic depends on their internal structure and values.
