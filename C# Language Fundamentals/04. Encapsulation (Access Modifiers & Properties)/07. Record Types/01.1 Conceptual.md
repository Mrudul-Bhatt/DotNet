Let's explore record types in C\#, their purpose, behavior, and distinctions.

### 1\. What is a record type in C\#? How does it differ from a class?

A **record** is a special kind of class (or struct, as we'll see later) in C\# that was introduced specifically for scenarios involving **data-centric types**. Records are designed to simplify working with immutable data and provide built-in functionality that is often cumbersome to implement manually in traditional classes.

The key differences between a `record` and a `class` lie in their default behavior, particularly around immutability, equality, and mutation.

| Feature                 | Record (Reference Type by Default)             | Class (Reference Type)                       |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Purpose** | Data-centric, immutable by default. Value-based equality. | Behavior-centric, mutable by default. Reference-based equality. |
| **Default Immutability**| **Immutable by default** (if using primary constructors or init-only setters). | **Mutable by default** (properties have `get; set;`). |
| **Equality (`Equals`)** | **Value-based equality**. Two records are equal if their types are the same and all public fields and properties have equal values. | **Reference-based equality**. Two class instances are equal only if they refer to the *exact same object* in memory. |
| **`GetHashCode()`** | **Value-based hashing**. Automatically generated based on the values of public fields and properties. | **Reference-based hashing**. Default implementation returns a hash code based on the object's memory address. |
| **`ToString()`** | **Nicely formatted string representation**. Automatically generated, including the type name and the names and values of all public fields and properties. | **Default `ToString()` returns the fully qualified type name**. You almost always need to override it for meaningful output. |
| **Non-Destructive Mutation** | Supports `with` expressions for **non-destructive mutation**, allowing you to create a new record instance with some modified properties while keeping the original intact. | No built-in `with` expression support. Requires manual copying (e.g., using a copy constructor) to achieve non-destructive mutation. |
| **Inheritance** | Can inherit from other records. Supports single inheritance. | Supports single inheritance from a base class. |
| **Deconstruction** | Implicitly supports deconstruction for primary constructor parameters. | No implicit deconstruction. Can implement `Deconstruct` method manually. |

**Example using a `record`:**

```csharp
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);

// Usage:
Person p1 = new("John", "Doe");
Person p2 = new("John", "Doe");
Person p3 = new("Jane", "Doe");

Console.WriteLine(p1 == p2);       // Output: True (Value-based equality)
Console.WriteLine(p1 == p3);       // Output: False

Console.WriteLine(p1.ToString());  // Output: Person { FirstName = John, LastName = Doe }

// Non-destructive mutation using 'with' expression
Person p4 = p1 with { LastName = "Smith" };
Console.WriteLine(p4);             // Output: Person { FirstName = John, LastName = Smith }
Console.WriteLine(p1);             // Output: Person { FirstName = John, LastName = Doe } (original p1 unchanged)
```

**Example using a `class` (for comparison):**

```csharp
public class ClassicPerson
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }

    public ClassicPerson(string firstName, string lastName)
    {
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
    }
}

// Usage:
ClassicPerson cp1 = new("John", "Doe");
ClassicPerson cp2 = new("John", "Doe"); // Different object in memory
ClassicPerson cp3 = new("Jane", "Doe");

Console.WriteLine(cp1 == cp2);       // Output: False (Reference-based equality)
Console.WriteLine(cp1.Equals(cp2));  // Output: False (Reference-based equality by default)

Console.WriteLine(cp1.ToString());   // Output: ClassicPerson (default class ToString())

// To achieve non-destructive mutation, you'd need a copy constructor:
// ClassicPerson cp4 = new ClassicPerson(cp1.FirstName, "Smith");
```

### 2\. Why were record types introduced in C\# 9? What problem do they solve?

Record types were introduced in C\# 9 primarily to address the challenges of working with **immutable data models** and to reduce the boilerplate code traditionally required for such types.

The problems they solve include:

1.  **Boilerplate for Immutable Data:**

      * **Problem:** Before records, creating a truly immutable class was verbose. You had to:
          * Make all properties `get`-only or `init`-only.
          * Write a constructor to initialize all properties.
          * Manually override `Equals()`, `GetHashCode()`, and `ToString()` to provide value-based semantics.
          * Implement copy constructors or helper methods to enable "non-destructive mutation" (creating a new instance with a few changes).
      * **Solution:** Records provide this functionality out-of-the-box with concise syntax, dramatically reducing boilerplate.

2.  **Value-Based Equality for Data:**

      * **Problem:** By default, classes use reference equality, meaning two objects are considered equal only if they are the exact same instance in memory. For data objects (like a `Point` or `CustomerDetails`), you often care if their *values* are the same, not if they're the same instance. Implementing value-based equality manually (overriding `Equals` and `GetHashCode`) is error-prone and tedious.
      * **Solution:** Records automatically generate value-based `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` implementations.

3.  **Simplified Debugging and Logging:**

      * **Problem:** The default `ToString()` for classes just outputs the type name, which is unhelpful for inspecting data. Developers often had to manually override `ToString()` for every data class to get meaningful output for logging or debugging.
      * **Solution:** Records automatically generate a useful `ToString()` method that prints the type name and the names and values of all public properties/fields.

4.  **Non-Destructive Mutation (`with` expression):**

      * **Problem:** When working with immutable objects, if you want to make a small change (e.g., change a person's last name), you can't mutate the existing object. You have to create a *new* object with the desired change. Manually writing copy constructors or helper methods for this (e.g., `person.WithLastName("Smith")`) is cumbersome.
      * **Solution:** Records provide the `with` expression, which simplifies this pattern immensely. It automatically generates a `Clone` method and a copy constructor, enabling a concise syntax for creating modified copies.

In essence, records streamline the development of data models, making them safer (due to immutability by default) and easier to use, especially in functional programming paradigms or when dealing with concepts like DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and immutable state management.

### 3\. What is the default behavior of equality and `ToString()` in a record vs class?

This is a core distinguishing feature of records:

**Equality (`Equals()` and `==` operator):**

  * **Classes (Default Behavior):**

      * Default `Equals(object obj)` and `==` operator perform **reference equality**.
      * They return `true` only if both variables refer to the **exact same object in memory**.
      * Example: `new MyClass() == new MyClass()` is `false`, even if all properties have the same values, because they are different objects.

  * **Records (Default Behavior):**

      * Default `Equals(object obj)`, `Equals(recordType other)`, and the `==` operator perform **value-based equality**.
      * They return `true` if the two records are of the **same runtime type** and **all public fields and properties have matching values**.
      * Example: `new MyRecord("A") == new MyRecord("A")` is `true`.

**`ToString()`:**

  * **Classes (Default Behavior):**

      * Default `ToString()` (inherited from `System.Object`) returns the **fully qualified type name** (e.g., `"MyNamespace.MyClass"`).
      * It does *not* include any information about the object's property values, making it unhelpful for debugging or logging.

  * **Records (Default Behavior):**

      * Automatically generates a `ToString()` override that provides a **concise, formatted string representation** of the record's data.
      * The output includes the record's type name, followed by the names and values of all public fields and properties.
      * Example: `new Person("John", "Doe").ToString()` outputs `Person { FirstName = John, LastName = Doe }`.

### 4\. Are records reference types or value types? How do they behave in memory?

By default, a `record` declared without the `struct` keyword (e.g., `public record Person(...)`) is a **reference type**.

**How they behave in memory (as reference types):**

  * **Heap Allocation:** Like classes, instances of records (the data itself) are allocated on the **managed heap**.
  * **Reference Semantics:** Variables of record types hold **references** (memory addresses) to the record instances on the heap.
  * **Garbage Collection:** Record instances on the heap are subject to garbage collection when they are no longer referenced.

**Despite being reference types, records have "value-like" behavior due to their built-in implementations of `Equals()`, `GetHashCode()`, and the `with` expression.** This is often confusing, but it's crucial to distinguish:

  * **Type Category:** Records are reference types (by default).
  * **Semantic Behavior:** They *behave* like value types in terms of equality and mutation patterns.

**Example of Memory Behavior:**

```csharp
public record Point(int X, int Y);

Point p1 = new(10, 20); // p1 is a reference to a Point object on the heap
Point p2 = new(10, 20); // p2 is a reference to a *different* Point object on the heap

Console.WriteLine(p1 == p2); // True (value-based equality checks if heap objects' contents are same)

Point p3 = p1; // p3 is now a reference to the *same* Point object as p1 on the heap

Console.WriteLine(p1 == p3); // True (reference equality also true)
```

In the above, `p1` and `p2` point to different memory locations but have the same content. `p3` points to the *same* memory location as `p1`.

### 5\. What’s the difference between a `record` and a `record struct` in C\#?

While `record` (without `struct`) defaults to a reference type, C\# 10 introduced **`record struct`** to allow the same record features (value-based equality, `ToString()`, `with` expressions, deconstruction) to be applied to **value types**.

| Feature                 | `record` (Reference Type)                     | `record struct` (Value Type)                   |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Type Category** | **Reference Type** (`class` by another name, with record features) | **Value Type** (`struct` with record features) |
| **Memory Allocation** | **Heap** (like a class)                       | **Stack** (for local vars/params) or **inline in heap obj** (for fields) |
| **Assignment** | Copies the **reference** (points to same object). | Copies the **actual data** (creates new, independent copy). |
| **Nullability** | Can be `null`.                                | Cannot be `null` (unless `Nullable<T>`, e.g., `Point?`). |
| **Boxing/Unboxing** | No boxing (already a reference type).         | Can incur boxing/unboxing overhead.            |
| **Use Cases** | Immutable data where identity isn't critical, but might be large or need `null` semantics. | Small, immutable data structures where heap allocation/GC overhead is a concern. |

**Example `record struct`:**

```csharp
public record struct PointStruct(int X, int Y);

// Usage:
PointStruct ps1 = new(10, 20); // ps1 on stack
PointStruct ps2 = new(10, 20); // ps2 on stack, different memory location
PointStruct ps3 = ps1;         // ps3 is a bit-wise copy of ps1, also on stack (if local)

Console.WriteLine(ps1 == ps2); // Output: True (Value-based equality, like records)
Console.WriteLine(ps1 == ps3); // Output: True (Value-based equality)

Console.WriteLine(ps1.ToString()); // Output: PointStruct { X = 10, Y = 20 } (like records)

PointStruct ps4 = ps1 with { Y = 30 };
Console.WriteLine(ps4);           // Output: PointStruct { X = 10, Y = 30 }
Console.WriteLine(ps1);           // Output: PointStruct { X = 10, Y = 20 } (original ps1 unchanged)
```

The choice between `record` and `record struct` follows the same guidelines as choosing between `class` and `struct`:

  * **`record` (reference type):** For larger data structures, when `null` is a valid state, when identity might sometimes matter (even if value equality is default), or when polymorphic behavior through inheritance is needed.
  * **`record struct` (value type):** For small, immutable data structures (typically 16-24 bytes or less) where memory footprint and avoiding GC pressure are paramount, and when copying by value is efficient.

### 6\. Can you inherit from a record? Can records be sealed or abstract?

**Yes, you can inherit from a record.**
**Yes, records can be `sealed` or `abstract`.**

**Inheritance with Records:**

  * Records support **single inheritance** from other records.
  * A record can inherit from a base record, and derived records automatically participate in value-based equality, `ToString()`, and `with` expressions based on their own properties *and* those of their base record.
  * The primary constructor parameters of the base record must be included in the derived record's primary constructor.

**Example of Record Inheritance:**

```csharp
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName); // Base record

public record Student(string FirstName, string LastName, int Id, string Major) : Person(FirstName, LastName); // Derived record

// Usage:
Person p = new Student("Alice", "Smith", 123, "Computer Science");
Console.WriteLine(p); // Output: Student { FirstName = Alice, LastName = Smith, Id = 123, Major = Computer Science }

Student s1 = new("Bob", "Johnson", 456, "Physics");
Student s2 = new("Bob", "Johnson", 456, "Physics");
Student s3 = new("Bob", "Johnson", 789, "Chemistry");

Console.WriteLine(s1 == s2); // True (value-based equality)
Console.WriteLine(s1 == s3); // False (Id and Major differ)

// 'with' expressions work correctly with inheritance
Student s4 = s1 with { Id = 555 };
Console.WriteLine(s4); // Output: Student { FirstName = Bob, LastName = Johnson, Id = 555, Major = Physics }
```

When comparing derived records, the equality check includes all members of the inheritance hierarchy.

**Records and `sealed` / `abstract`:**

  * **`sealed` records:** You can mark a record as `sealed` to prevent any other record from inheriting from it. This is useful when you want to explicitly declare that a record represents a final type in a hierarchy.

    ```csharp
    public sealed record FinalProduct(string Name, decimal Price);
    // public record SpecialProduct(string Name, decimal Price, string Feature) : FinalProduct(Name, Price); // Compile-time error
    ```

  * **`abstract` records:** You can mark a record as `abstract` if it's intended to be a base type that cannot be instantiated directly. An `abstract` record must have concrete (non-abstract) derived records that implement any abstract members it declares.

    ```csharp
    public abstract record Shape(string Color);

    public record Circle(string Color, double Radius) : Shape(Color);

    // Usage:
    // Shape s = new Shape("Red"); // Compile-time error: Cannot create an instance of the abstract record 'Shape'
    Shape c = new Circle("Blue", 10);
    Console.WriteLine(c); // Output: Circle { Color = Blue, Radius = 10 }
    ```
