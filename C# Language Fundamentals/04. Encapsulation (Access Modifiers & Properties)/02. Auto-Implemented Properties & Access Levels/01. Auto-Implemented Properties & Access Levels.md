Let's delve into auto-implemented properties in C\# and explore various scenarios for their access levels, particularly focusing on `get; private set;` and other forms of controlled write access.

## Auto-Implemented Properties & Access Levels

Auto-implemented properties (also known as automatic properties) in C\# provide a concise syntax for declaring properties. When you use an auto-implemented property, the compiler automatically creates a private backing field for you.

**Basic Syntax:**

```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```

This is equivalent to:

```c#
private string _name; // Compiler-generated backing field

public string Name
{
    get { return _name; }
    set { _name = value; }
}
```

The true power comes when you start playing with the access levels of the `get` and `set` accessors.

### 1\. `get; set;` (Public Read/Write)

This is the most common and least restrictive form. Both the getter and setter are public, meaning any code can read or write to this property.

**Scenario:** Simple data containers (like DTOs or view models) where direct modification is acceptable and no complex business logic is required on set.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
public class UserDto
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; } // Any code can read or write to Email
}

public class PublicReadWriteExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        UserDto user = new UserDto();
        user.Id = 1;
        user.Username = "john_doe";
        user.Email = "john.doe@example.com"; // Allowed

        Console.WriteLine($"User: {user.Username}, Email: {user.Email}");

        user.Email = "new.email@example.com"; // Allowed
        Console.WriteLine($"Updated Email: {user.Email}");
    }
}
```

**Role in Encapsulation:** Provides no encapsulation for the setter. While convenient, it can lead to issues if this model represents a domain entity where state changes should be controlled by business rules.

### 2\. `get; private set;` (Public Read, Private Write)

This is a very common and powerful pattern for encapsulation. The property can be read by any code, but its value can only be set from within the class (or struct) where it's declared.

**Scenario:**

  * **Encapsulation of Internal State:** This is the primary use case. You want to expose data but control how and when it's modified.
  * **Immutable After Construction:** Often used with constructors to set initial values, ensuring the object's state is valid from creation and cannot be directly changed afterwards by external code.
  * **Calculated Properties:** The value might be calculated or derived from other internal state, and you don't want external code directly setting it.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class BankAccount
{
    // Publicly readable, but only settable within this BankAccount class
    public string AccountNumber { get; private set; }
    public decimal Balance { get; private set; } // Set only by Deposit/Withdraw methods

    // Read-only list of transactions, can be added to internally
    public IReadOnlyList<string> Transactions { get; private set; }

    // Private backing field for Transactions list
    private readonly List<string> _transactions;

    public BankAccount(string accountNumber, decimal initialBalance)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(accountNumber))
            throw new ArgumentException("Account number cannot be empty.", nameof(accountNumber));
        if (initialBalance < 0)
            throw new ArgumentException("Initial balance cannot be negative.", nameof(initialBalance));

        AccountNumber = accountNumber; // Allowed, as it's within the class's constructor
        Balance = initialBalance;       // Allowed
        _transactions = new List<string> { $"Account created with {initialBalance:C}" };
        Transactions = _transactions.AsReadOnly(); // Expose as read-only view
    }

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount <= 0)
            throw new ArgumentException("Deposit amount must be positive.");

        Balance += amount; // Allowed, as it's within the class
        _transactions.Add($"Deposited {amount:C}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Deposited {amount:C}. New balance: {Balance:C}");
    }

    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount <= 0)
            throw new ArgumentException("Withdrawal amount must be positive.");
        if (amount > Balance)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Insufficient funds.");

        Balance -= amount; // Allowed, as it's within the class
        _transactions.Add($"Withdrew {amount:C}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Withdrew {amount:C}. New balance: {Balance:C}");
    }
}

public class PrivateSetExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        BankAccount myAccount = new BankAccount("123456789", 500m);

        Console.WriteLine($"Account: {myAccount.AccountNumber}, Initial Balance: {myAccount.Balance:C}");

        myAccount.Deposit(200m);
        myAccount.Withdraw(100m);

        // myAccount.Balance = 1000m; // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Property or indexer 'BankAccount.Balance' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only

        // myAccount.Transactions.Add("External attempt"); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: 'IReadOnlyList<string>' does not contain a definition for 'Add'
                                                          // (because we exposed it as IReadOnlyList)

        Console.WriteLine("\nTransaction History:");
        foreach (var transaction in myAccount.Transactions)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"- {transaction}");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

  * `AccountNumber` and `Balance` can be read from anywhere, but their values can only be changed by methods *inside* the `BankAccount` class (like `Deposit`, `Withdraw`, or the constructor).
  * The `Transactions` list is internally a `List<string>` but exposed as `IReadOnlyList<string>`, preventing external code from adding or removing items directly.

**Role in Encapsulation:** Excellent. It allows you to expose data for reading while ensuring all modifications go through methods that can enforce business rules, validation, and maintain the object's integrity.

### 3\. `get;` (Read-Only)

This makes the property completely read-only. It can only be assigned a value in the constructor or by an initializer. There is no public or private setter.

**Scenario:**

  * **Truly Immutable Data:** When a property's value should never change after the object is created. This is ideal for value objects or configuration settings.
  * **Dependency Injection:** Properties that hold injected dependencies often use this pattern.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

public class ConfigSettings
{
    // These properties are read-only after object creation
    public string ApiBaseUrl { get; }
    public int MaxConnections { get; }
    public bool EnableTelemetry { get; }

    public ConfigSettings(string apiBaseUrl, int maxConnections, bool enableTelemetry)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(apiBaseUrl))
            throw new ArgumentException("API Base URL cannot be empty.", nameof(apiBaseUrl));
        if (maxConnections <= 0)
            throw new ArgumentException("Max connections must be positive.", nameof(maxConnections));

        ApiBaseUrl = apiBaseUrl;
        MaxConnections = maxConnections;
        EnableTelemetry = enableTelemetry;
    }

    // You could also have a parameterless constructor and set via object initializer if using
    // a configuration framework, but then the constructor validation is bypassed.
    // E.g., for JSON deserialization:
    // public ConfigSettings() { } // If this existed, you could do new ConfigSettings { ApiBaseUrl = "..." }
}

public class ReadOnlyPropertyExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ConfigSettings settings = new ConfigSettings("https://api.example.com", 10, true);

        Console.WriteLine($"API URL: {settings.ApiBaseUrl}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Max Connections: {settings.MaxConnections}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Telemetry Enabled: {settings.EnableTelemetry}");

        // settings.ApiBaseUrl = "new-url"; // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Property or indexer 'ConfigSettings.ApiBaseUrl' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only
    }
}
```

**Role in Encapsulation:** Very strong. Guarantees that the object's state, as represented by these properties, is fixed once constructed. Promotes thread safety and predictability.

### 4\. `get; protected set;` (Public Read, Protected Write)

The property can be read by any code, but its value can only be set from within the class where it's declared, or by a class that derives from it.

**Scenario:**

  * **Base Class Extensibility:** You want a base class to expose certain data that derived classes might need to set during their initialization or specific operations, but not arbitrary external code.
  * **Framework Design:** When building a framework, you might provide base classes with properties that are designed to be set by inheritors.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

public abstract class Vehicle
{
    public string Make { get; protected set; } // Settable by Vehicle or derived classes
    public string Model { get; protected set; }
    public int Year { get; private set; } // Settable only by Vehicle

    public Vehicle(int year)
    {
        Year = year;
        Console.WriteLine($"Vehicle from {Year} created.");
    }

    protected void SetDetails(string make, string model)
    {
        Make = make; // Allowed
        Model = model; // Allowed
        Console.WriteLine($"Set details: {Make} {Model}");
    }

    public virtual void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Make} {Model} starting...");
    }
}

public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public string Type { get; private set; }

    public Car(string make, string model, int year, string type) : base(year)
    {
        Type = type;
        SetDetails(make, model); // Allowed: Car is derived from Vehicle
        Console.WriteLine($"Car created: {make} {model} ({year}), Type: {type}");
    }

    public void Accelerate()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Make} {Model} is accelerating!");
    }

    public override void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Car specific start sequence for {Make} {Model}.");
        base.Start(); // Call base implementation
    }
}

public class ProtectedSetExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Car myCar = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022, "Sedan");

        Console.WriteLine($"Car Info: {myCar.Make} {myCar.Model} ({myCar.Year}) - Type: {myCar.Type}");

        // myCar.Make = "Toyota"; // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Property or indexer 'Vehicle.Make' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only (from outside the class hierarchy)
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

  * `Make` and `Model` can be set by `Vehicle` itself or by `Car` (which derives from `Vehicle`).
  * `Year` can only be set by `Vehicle` (in its constructor).
  * From outside the class hierarchy (e.g., in `Main`), `Make` and `Model` are read-only.

**Role in Encapsulation:** Provides a controlled form of encapsulation for inheritance. It hides implementation details from unrelated classes while allowing specific extensibility for derived types.

### 5\. `get; internal set;` (Public Read, Internal Write)

The property can be read by any code, but its value can only be set from within the same assembly where it's declared.

**Scenario:**

  * **Assembly-Level Encapsulation:** You have a multi-project solution (multiple assemblies) that forms a single logical component (like an SDK or a layered application). You want certain properties to be read publicly by external assemblies, but only settable by code within your own set of internal assemblies.
  * **Internal Frameworks/Libraries:** Components within your library might need to set a value, but external users of your library should not.

**Code Example (requires two separate projects/assemblies):**

**Project 1: `MyCompany.DataModels` (Class Library)**

```csharp
// File: MyCompany.DataModels/CustomerInfo.cs
namespace MyCompany.DataModels
{
    public class CustomerInfo
    {
        public int Id { get; internal set; } // Settable only within MyCompany.DataModels assembly
        public string Name { get; set; }     // Fully public read/write
        public string InternalNote { get; internal set; } // Settable only within MyCompany.DataModels assembly

        public CustomerInfo(int id, string name)
        {
            Id = id; // Allowed within the same assembly (constructor)
            Name = name;
        }

        // Example of internal logic setting the internal property
        internal void AddInternalNote(string note)
        {
            InternalNote = note;
        }
    }
}
```

**Project 2: `MyCompany.ServiceApp` (Console Application - References `MyCompany.DataModels`)**

```csharp
// File: MyCompany.ServiceApp/Program.cs
using System;
using MyCompany.DataModels;

namespace MyCompany.ServiceApp
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Create an instance of the data model
            CustomerInfo customer = new CustomerInfo(101, "Alice Smith");

            Console.WriteLine($"Customer Name: {customer.Name}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Customer ID: {customer.Id}"); // Can read Id

            // customer.Id = 102; // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Property or indexer 'CustomerInfo.Id' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only
                                // (because we are in a different assembly)

            // customer.InternalNote = "Cannot set this directly"; // COMPILE-TIME ERROR

            // If CustomerInfo had a method to set InternalNote (and that method was public/internal as needed)
            // customer.AddInternalNote("This is an internal memo."); // If AddInternalNote was internal, it would be error here too.
                                                                    // If AddInternalNote was public, it would work.
                                                                    // The setter is internal, so even a public method in THIS assembly cannot use it.
                                                                    // Only code in MyCompany.DataModels can use internal set.
            Console.WriteLine($"Internal Note: {customer.InternalNote}");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

  * `Id` and `InternalNote` can be read from `MyCompany.ServiceApp`, but *cannot* be set by it directly. They can only be set by code within the `MyCompany.DataModels` assembly.

**Role in Encapsulation:** Provides assembly-level encapsulation. Useful for creating libraries where some data needs to be visible to consumers but only modifiable by the library's own internal components.

### 6\. `get; protected internal set;` (Public Read, Protected OR Internal Write)

This is a combination of `protected` and `internal`. The property can be read by any code, and its value can be set by:

  * Code within the declaring class.
  * Code within any derived class (even in other assemblies).
  * Code within the same assembly (even if not derived).

**Scenario:**

  * **Framework Extensibility with Internal Setup:** When you have a base class that should be extensible by derived classes, and also have internal helper classes within your framework that need to set its properties.

**Code Example (requires two assemblies and inheritance):**

**Project 1: `MyFramework.Core` (Class Library)**

```csharp
// File: MyFramework.Core/FrameworkEntity.cs
using System;

namespace MyFramework.Core
{
    public abstract class FrameworkEntity
    {
        // Publicly readable. Settable by FrameworkEntity itself, derived classes (any assembly),
        // or any class within MyFramework.Core assembly.
        public string Status { get; protected internal set; }

        public DateTime LastModified { get; protected internal set; }

        public FrameworkEntity()
        {
            Status = "Created"; // Allowed (within declaring class)
            LastModified = DateTime.UtcNow;
        }

        // Internal helper method within the same assembly that can set it
        internal void MarkAsProcessed()
        {
            Status = "Processed"; // Allowed (within same assembly)
            LastModified = DateTime.UtcNow;
            Console.WriteLine($"[FrameworkEntity] Marked as '{Status}' at {LastModified}");
        }

        public virtual void DoWork()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"[FrameworkEntity] Doing generic work. Status: {Status}");
        }
    }
}
```

**Project 2: `MyApplication.BusinessLogic` (Class Library - References `MyFramework.Core`)**

```csharp
// File: MyApplication.BusinessLogic/ConcreteEntity.cs
using System;
using MyFramework.Core; // Reference the framework core

namespace MyApplication.BusinessLogic
{
    public class ConcreteEntity : FrameworkEntity
    {
        public string EntityName { get; private set; }

        public ConcreteEntity(string name) : base()
        {
            EntityName = name;
            Status = "Initialized"; // Allowed: Derived class can set it
            Console.WriteLine($"[ConcreteEntity] '{EntityName}' initialized. Status: {Status}");
        }

        public override void DoWork()
        {
            base.DoWork();
            Status = "Working"; // Allowed: Derived class can set it
            Console.WriteLine($"[ConcreteEntity] Doing specific work for {EntityName}. Status: {Status}");
        }

        public void CompleteWork()
        {
            Status = "Completed"; // Allowed: Derived class can set it
            Console.WriteLine($"[ConcreteEntity] '{EntityName}' work completed. Status: {Status}");
        }
    }
}
```

**Project 3: `MyApplication.ConsoleApp` (Console Application - References `MyFramework.Core` and `MyApplication.BusinessLogic`)**

```csharp
// File: MyApplication.ConsoleApp/Program.cs
using System;
using MyFramework.Core;
using MyApplication.BusinessLogic;

namespace MyApplication.ConsoleApp
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            ConcreteEntity entity = new ConcreteEntity("Task Alpha");

            Console.WriteLine($"Initial Status: {entity.Status}");
            entity.DoWork();
            Console.WriteLine($"Status after DoWork: {entity.Status}");
            entity.CompleteWork();
            Console.WriteLine($"Final Status: {entity.Status}");

            // entity.Status = "Attempt to set externally"; // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Property or indexer 'FrameworkEntity.Status' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

  * `Status` can be set by `FrameworkEntity` itself.
  * `ConcreteEntity` (a derived class in a different assembly) can also set `Status`.
  * Any class within the `MyFramework.Core` assembly (e.g., an internal helper) could also set `Status`.
  * However, `MyApplication.ConsoleApp` (an unrelated class in a different assembly) cannot set `Status` directly.

**Role in Encapsulation:** A specific and less common access level that balances the need for internal framework control with extensibility for consumers who build upon your base classes.

### 7\. `get; private protected set;` (Public Read, Private OR Protected Write within Same Assembly)

This is the most restrictive combination. The property can be read by any code, but its value can only be set by:

  * Code within the declaring class.
  * Code within any derived class *that is in the same assembly* as the declaring class.

**Scenario:**

  * **Tight Internal Component Hierarchy:** When you have a base class and derived classes within the *same* assembly that need to share certain modifiable state, but this state should absolutely not be exposed to derived classes or other code outside that specific assembly.

**Code Example (requires inheritance within the same assembly):**

**Project 1: `MyCompany.CoreComponents` (Class Library)**

```csharp
// File: MyCompany.CoreComponents/BaseComponent.cs
using System;

namespace MyCompany.CoreComponents
{
    public abstract class BaseComponent
    {
        // Publicly readable. Settable by BaseComponent itself, or by derived classes
        // ONLY IF those derived classes are also in MyCompany.CoreComponents assembly.
        public string ComponentState { get; private protected set; }

        public BaseComponent()
        {
            ComponentState = "Initialized";
        }

        protected void UpdateState(string newState)
        {
            ComponentState = newState; // Allowed: within declaring class
            Console.WriteLine($"[BaseComponent] State updated to: {ComponentState}");
        }
    }

    public class SpecificComponent : BaseComponent
    {
        public SpecificComponent() : base()
        {
            ComponentState = "Specific Init"; // Allowed: Derived class in same assembly
        }

        public void PerformAction()
        {
            UpdateState("Performing Action"); // Allowed: Calls protected method which sets it
            ComponentState = "Action Completed"; // Allowed: Derived class in same assembly
        }
    }
}
```

**Project 2: `MyApplication.ExternalConsumer` (Console Application - References `MyCompany.CoreComponents`)**

```csharp
// File: MyApplication.ExternalConsumer/Program.cs
using System;
using MyCompany.CoreComponents;

namespace MyApplication.ExternalConsumer
{
    // This class is in a DIFFERENT assembly
    public class ExternalDerivedComponent : BaseComponent
    {
        public ExternalDerivedComponent() : base()
        {
            // ComponentState = "External Init"; // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Cannot set, because this derived class is in a different assembly.
        }
    }

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            SpecificComponent comp = new SpecificComponent();
            Console.WriteLine($"Initial State: {comp.ComponentState}");
            comp.PerformAction();
            Console.WriteLine($"Final State: {comp.ComponentState}");

            ExternalDerivedComponent extComp = new ExternalDerivedComponent();
            Console.WriteLine($"External Derived State: {extComp.ComponentState}");

            // comp.ComponentState = "Attempt external set"; // COMPILE-TIME ERROR
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

  * `ComponentState` can be set by `BaseComponent` and `SpecificComponent` (which is derived and in the same assembly).
  * `ExternalDerivedComponent` (derived but in a *different* assembly) cannot set `ComponentState` directly.
  * `MyApplication.ExternalConsumer` (an unrelated class) cannot set it.

**Role in Encapsulation:** Very strong, combines the strictness of `private` with the flexibility of `protected` but strictly limits that flexibility to within the defining assembly. This is less common but powerful for tightly controlled internal hierarchies.

### Key Takeaways for Controlled Write Access:

  * **Default to `private set;`:** If you're designing a class that represents a real-world entity or has internal state that needs protection, `public get; private set;` should be your default. It provides the best balance of data exposure and encapsulation.
  * **Consider Read-Only (`get;`):** If a property should absolutely never change after construction, make it `get;` only and set it via the constructor. This creates immutable objects, which are excellent for predictability and thread safety.
  * **Use `internal set;` for Assembly-Specific Logic:** When building libraries or layered architectures, `internal set;` is great for exposing data publicly while allowing only your internal components to modify it.
  * **Use `protected set;` for Designed Extensibility:** If you want to provide specific hooks for derived classes to modify properties, use `protected set;`.
  * **Use `private protected set;` or `protected internal set;` for Niche Scenarios:** These are for very specific architectural needs involving complex assembly and inheritance hierarchies. They are less common but powerful when their specific combination of access is required.

By carefully choosing the access level for your property setters, you can precisely control how your objects' state can be modified, leading to more robust, maintainable, and predictable code.
