Let's explore common pitfalls and best practices in exception handling, particularly when dealing with shared libraries, user interfaces, and external integrations.

-----

### ðŸ”¹ You catch a general `Exception` in a shared library. Later, critical exceptions like `OutOfMemoryException` are being swallowed silently. Whatâ€™s the issue?

(Bad practice â€” never catch all exceptions unless you rethrow or handle critical system exceptions separately.)

**The Issue:**

Catching a general `System.Exception` (or a bare `catch`) in a shared library is almost universally considered a **bad practice** because it inadvertently catches *all* exceptions, including critical and often unrecoverable system-level exceptions like:

  * **`OutOfMemoryException`**: Indicates your application has run out of available memory. Continuing could lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
  * **`StackOverflowException`**: Usually caused by infinite recursion. The application's state is compromised.
  * **`AccessViolationException`**: Indicates an attempt to read or write to protected memory, often due to corrupted state.
  * **`ThreadAbortException`**: Thrown when `Thread.Abort()` is called (though its use is discouraged).
  * **`BadImageFormatException`**: Occurs if a DLL or executable is corrupt or invalid.

**Consequences of Silently Swallowing Critical Exceptions:**

1.  **Masking Serious Problems:** You prevent these critical errors from propagating up the call stack to a global error handler, crash reporting system, or the operating system. This means you won't know that your application is in a severely compromised state.
2.  **Unstable Application State:** The application might continue to run in an unstable or corrupt state, leading to further, unpredictable errors, data corruption, or even security vulnerabilities, rather than failing fast and predictably.
3.  **Debugging Nightmares:** Since the exception is swallowed, debugging becomes incredibly difficult. The original source of the critical issue is hidden, and you might only see follow-on symptoms rather than the root cause.
4.  **Violating Fail-Fast Principle:** Good software design often adheres to the "fail-fast" principle, where an application should terminate quickly and loudly when it encounters an unrecoverable error, to prevent further damage. Catching `Exception` broadly thwarts this.

**Recommendation:**

  * **Catch Specific Exceptions:** Only catch the specific exception types that you anticipate and can genuinely recover from or handle meaningfully.

  * **Re-throw if Not Handled:** If you *must* catch `Exception` (e.g., at a very top-level application boundary for logging), always re-throw it (`throw;`) after logging, so the application can still terminate or a higher-level handler can take over.

  * **Filter Critical Exceptions (Advanced/Rare):** In extremely specific scenarios, you might use an `Exception Filter` (available in C\# 6+) to catch `Exception` but *re-throw* critical ones. This is complex and usually not recommended over simply not catching them in the first place.

    ```csharp
    // Example of dangerous practice
    public void DangerousLibraryMethod()
    {
        try
        {
            // Some operation that might cause OutOfMemory
            byte[] largeArray = new byte[int.MaxValue];
        }
        catch (Exception ex) // Catches everything, including OOM
        {
            Console.WriteLine("An error occurred in the library, but we'll continue.");
            // The OOM exception is silently suppressed here!
        }
    }

    // Recommended approach (if you can't be more specific)
    public void SaferLibraryMethod()
    {
        try
        {
            // Some operation
            SomeRiskyOperation();
        }
        catch (OutOfMemoryException) // Catch specific critical ones if needed for specific logging, then re-throw
        {
            Console.Error.WriteLine("CRITICAL: Out of Memory in SaferLibraryMethod!");
            throw; // ALWAYS re-throw critical exceptions!
        }
        catch (IOException ex) // Catch expected, recoverable exceptions
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Handled a recoverable I/O error: {ex.Message}");
            // Specific recovery logic
        }
        // No catch-all unless it's a top-level boundary doing full logging and exiting
    }
    ```

-----

### ðŸ”¹ Youâ€™re building a file importer. Which specific exceptions would you catch, and which ones would you allow to bubble up?

(Catch `IOException`, `FileNotFoundException`, `UnauthorizedAccessException`, `FormatException` (for parsing); allow fatal ones like `OutOfMemoryException` to bubble up.)

**Scenario:** A file importer needs to read a file, parse its contents, and then process the data.

**Exceptions to Catch (Expected and Recoverable):**

These are specific I/O or data-parsing related exceptions that you can anticipate and potentially handle gracefully or provide informative feedback for.

  * **`FileNotFoundException`**:
      * **Reason to catch:** The file specified by the user or configuration does not exist.
      * **Handling:** Inform the user, log the specific file path that was missing, prompt for a new path, or skip the file.
  * **`DirectoryNotFoundException`**:
      * **Reason to catch:** Similar to `FileNotFoundException`, but the containing directory is missing.
      * **Handling:** Inform the user, log, or prompt for a valid directory.
  * **`UnauthorizedAccessException`**:
      * **Reason to catch:** The application does not have the necessary permissions to read/write the file.
      * **Handling:** Inform the user about permission issues, suggest running as administrator, or log for administrator review.
  * **`IOException`**:
      * **Reason to catch:** A general I/O error (e.g., disk full, file locked by another process, network drive unavailable). This is a base class for many specific I/O exceptions, so it can catch others not explicitly listed if placed after them.
      * **Handling:** Inform the user, suggest checking disk space/file locks, implement retry logic, or log.
  * **`FormatException`**:
      * **Reason to catch:** If you're parsing numbers, dates, or other structured data from the file, and a string is not in the correct format.
      * **Handling:** Log the specific line/data that failed, skip the invalid record, or report parsing errors to the user.
  * **`NotSupportedException`**:
      * **Reason to catch:** If the file format itself is not supported or a particular operation (like seeking) is not supported by the stream type.
      * **Handling:** Inform the user about unsupported file types or features.

**Exceptions to Allow to Bubble Up (Unanticipated or Fatal):**

These exceptions typically indicate a serious problem that the file importer itself cannot gracefully recover from. They should propagate up to a higher-level (e.g., global) error handler for logging and application termination.

  * **`OutOfMemoryException`**: The application ran out of memory. There's no way for the file importer to "recover" from this.
  * **`StackOverflowException`**: Likely due to infinite recursion in parsing logic. The application state is broken.
  * **`NullReferenceException` (mostly)**: While sometimes caught for debugging, a `NullReferenceException` often indicates a coding bug (a missing null check where one was expected) rather than an environmental issue. It's usually better to let these expose themselves during development/testing.
  * **`ArgumentException` (and its derivatives like `ArgumentNullException`, `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`)**: Often indicates a bug in how parameters are being passed to methods within your file importer or library calls. These usually point to internal logic errors rather than external file system issues.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

public static class FileImporter
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- File Importer Exception Handling ---");

        // Scenario 1: File not found
        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 1: Non-existent file.");
        ImportDataFromFile("nonexistent.txt");

        // Scenario 2: Invalid data format (simulated)
        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 2: Invalid data format.");
        ImportDataFromFile("invalid_data.csv");

        // Scenario 3: Permissions issue (simulated)
        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 3: Permissions issue.");
        ImportDataFromFile("no_permission.log");

        // Scenario 4: Critical error (e.g., OutOfMemory - letting it bubble)
        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 4: Critical error (should bubble up).");
        try
        {
            ImportDataFromFile("critical_error_sim.txt");
        }
        catch (OutOfMemoryException ex) // Catches the bubbled-up critical exception
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"[Main App]: Caught CRITICAL bubbled-up exception: {ex.Message}. Application state compromised.");
            // Log to crash reporter, graceful shutdown attempts etc.
        }

        Console.WriteLine();
    }

    public static void ImportDataFromFile(string filePath)
    {
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Importer]: Attempting to import from: {filePath}");

            if (filePath == "nonexistent.txt")
                throw new FileNotFoundException("File does not exist.", filePath);
            if (filePath == "no_permission.log")
                throw new UnauthorizedAccessException("Access denied to file.", filePath);
            if (filePath == "invalid_data.csv")
                throw new FormatException("Invalid number format in file content.");
            if (filePath == "critical_error_sim.txt")
                throw new OutOfMemoryException("Simulating an out of memory condition.");

            // Simulate reading and parsing
            Console.WriteLine("  [Importer]: File read and parsed successfully.");
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Importer Catch]: ERROR: The file '{ex.FileName}' was not found. Please check the path.");
            // Specific recovery: prompt user, default data, etc.
        }
        catch (UnauthorizedAccessException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Importer Catch]: ERROR: Access denied to '{ex.Message}'. Please check file permissions.");
            // Specific recovery: inform user, suggest running as admin
        }
        catch (IOException ex) // Catches other I/O errors not specifically caught above
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Importer Catch]: ERROR: A general I/O error occurred: {ex.Message}.");
            // General I/O recovery: retry, check disk space etc.
        }
        catch (FormatException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Importer Catch]: ERROR: Data parsing failed: {ex.Message}. Please check file content format.");
            // Data parsing recovery: skip line, log error line number
        }
        // DO NOT catch System.Exception here if you want critical exceptions to bubble up
        // Any other exception (like OutOfMemoryException) will bubble up from this method
        finally
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Importer]: File import attempt for {filePath} finished.");
        }
    }
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ A teammate wrote this: `catch (Exception ex) { Log(ex.Message); }`. What would you recommend improving?

(Log full stack trace (`ex.ToString()`), rethrow if unhandled, avoid hiding issues silently.)

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

This is a common but very problematic pattern. Here's what to recommend:

1.  **Log the Full Exception Details:**

      * **Problem:** `ex.Message` provides only the top-level error message. It omits the `StackTrace`, `InnerException` (if any), and the `Exception Type`. Without these, debugging is severely hampered, as you don't know where the error originated or what underlying issues caused it.
      * **Recommendation:** Always log `ex.ToString()`. This method provides all available details of the exception hierarchy.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    // BAD
    // Log(ex.Message);

    // GOOD
    Log(ex.ToString()); // This includes Type, Message, StackTrace, InnerException details
    ```

2.  **Avoid Silently Swallowing Exceptions (Re-throw if Not Fully Handled):**

      * **Problem:** The current code catches *all* exceptions and simply logs them, then allows execution to continue as if no error occurred. This "swallows" the exception. If the calling code needs to be aware of the failure (e.g., to display an error to the user, trigger a retry, or halt execution), it won't be. This is especially dangerous for unexpected exceptions.
      * **Recommendation:**
          * **If truly handled and recoverable:** Only catch specific exceptions you can fully recover from.
          * **If not fully recoverable:** After logging, **re-throw** the exception using `throw;` (which preserves the original stack trace) or throw a new, more specific exception with the original as an `InnerException`. This allows higher layers of the application to handle the error or for it to eventually reach a global error handler.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    try
    {
        // Some operation
    }
    catch (Exception ex) // If you must catch general Exception
    {
        Log(ex.ToString()); // Log full details

        // Option A: Re-throw if you're only logging and not fully handling
        throw; // Preserves original stack trace and propagates the same exception

        // Option B: Throw a new, more specific exception with original as inner (e.g., for API boundaries)
        // throw new CustomApplicationException("A business process failed.", ex);

        // Option C: Only if the error is completely anticipated and fully recoverable at this level
        // (and you'd probably catch a more specific exception in this case)
        // Console.WriteLine("Operation failed but we can continue.");
    }
    ```

### ðŸ”¹ In a payment gateway integration, you want to show user-friendly messages for known API failures but log others. How would you structure your `catch` blocks?

(Catch specific known exceptions first, show friendly message; catch general afterward, log, and fallback.)

**Scenario:** When interacting with a payment gateway, certain API errors might be common and have specific user-facing messages (e.g., "Invalid credit card number," "Insufficient funds"). Other, less common or unexpected errors should be logged internally for investigation.

**Structure:**

This is a perfect use case for multiple `catch` blocks, ordered from most specific (known API errors) to most general (unexpected errors).

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http; // For HTTP-related errors, common in API integrations
using System.Data.SqlClient; // Just as an example for another specific error

// Simulate specific payment gateway exceptions
public class PaymentGatewayException : Exception
{
    public PaymentGatewayErrorCode ErrorCode { get; }
    public PaymentGatewayException(string message, PaymentGatewayErrorCode code, Exception innerException = null)
        : base(message, innerException)
    {
        ErrorCode = code;
    }
}

public enum PaymentGatewayErrorCode
{
    Unknown = 0,
    InvalidCreditCard = 101,
    InsufficientFunds = 102,
    TransactionDeclined = 103,
    ApiRateLimitExceeded = 201
}

public static class PaymentIntegration
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Payment Gateway Exception Handling ---");

        // Scenario 1: Invalid credit card
        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 1: Invalid credit card.");
        ProcessPayment(PaymentGatewayErrorCode.InvalidCreditCard);

        // Scenario 2: Insufficient funds
        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 2: Insufficient funds.");
        ProcessPayment(PaymentGatewayErrorCode.InsufficientFunds);

        // Scenario 3: Network timeout (HttpRequestException)
        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 3: Network timeout.");
        ProcessPayment("HttpRequestException");

        // Scenario 4: Unknown/unexpected error
        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 4: Unknown internal error.");
        ProcessPayment("InternalServerError");

        Console.WriteLine();
    }

    public static bool ProcessPayment(object errorType = null)
    {
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Payment]: Attempting payment...");

            // Simulate different error conditions based on input
            if (errorType is PaymentGatewayErrorCode errorCode)
            {
                throw new PaymentGatewayException("Payment gateway reported an error.", errorCode);
            }
            else if (errorType is string stringError)
            {
                if (stringError == "HttpRequestException")
                {
                    throw new HttpRequestException("The request timed out.", new TimeoutException());
                }
                else if (stringError == "InternalServerError")
                {
                    throw new ApplicationException("An unexpected internal error occurred.");
                }
            }
            // Simulate success
            Console.WriteLine("  [Payment]: Payment successful!");
            return true;
        }
        // 1. Catch specific, known payment gateway business errors (most specific)
        catch (PaymentGatewayException pgEx) when (pgEx.ErrorCode == PaymentGatewayErrorCode.InvalidCreditCard)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("  [Payment Error]: User-friendly message: Your credit card number is invalid. Please check and try again.");
            // Log for internal debugging, but no need to alert high severity
            LogPaymentError(pgEx, "Invalid credit card provided.");
            return false;
        }
        catch (PaymentGatewayException pgEx) when (pgEx.ErrorCode == PaymentGatewayErrorCode.InsufficientFunds)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("  [Payment Error]: User-friendly message: Your account has insufficient funds. Please use another payment method.");
            LogPaymentError(pgEx, "Insufficient funds.");
            return false;
        }
        catch (PaymentGatewayException pgEx)
        {
            // Catch other known PaymentGatewayException types that might not have custom UI messages
            Console.WriteLine("  [Payment Error]: User-friendly message: A problem occurred with your payment. Please try again later or contact support.");
            LogPaymentError(pgEx, "Other known payment gateway error.");
            return false;
        }
        // 2. Catch common integration-level exceptions (e.g., network issues)
        catch (HttpRequestException httpEx)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("  [Payment Error]: User-friendly message: We are unable to connect to the payment service. Please check your internet connection and try again.");
            LogPaymentError(httpEx, "HTTP request failed to payment gateway.");
            return false;
        }
        // 3. Catch general exceptions (unexpected errors)
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("  [Payment Error]: User-friendly message: An unexpected error occurred. Our team has been notified. Please try again later.");
            // Log full details for internal investigation (high severity)
            LogPaymentError(ex, "Unexpected error during payment processing.");
            return false;
        }
        finally
        {
            Console.WriteLine("  [Payment]: Payment processing attempt finished.");
        }
    }

    private static void LogPaymentError(Exception ex, string customMessage)
    {
        Console.Error.WriteLine($"    [Internal Log - ERROR]: {customMessage}. Exception: {ex.ToString()}");
        // In a real app, this would send to a structured logging system like Serilog, NLog, or ELK stack.
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Specific `PaymentGatewayException` catches (with `when` clauses):** These are the most granular. They check for specific `ErrorCode` values within your custom payment gateway exception type. This allows for precise user-friendly messages.
2.  **General `PaymentGatewayException` catch:** This catches any other `PaymentGatewayException` types that don't match the `when` clauses above. You can provide a generic user-friendly message for these.
3.  **Integration-specific `HttpRequestException` catch:** This handles network or HTTP-related errors common when integrating with external APIs.
4.  **General `Exception` catch:** This is the fallback for *any* other unanticipated error. It provides a generic user-friendly message and, most importantly, logs the *full details* of the exception for internal debugging and monitoring. This ensures no errors go unnoticed by developers.

### ðŸ”¹ Have you ever used custom exceptions? When did a specific catch block help avoid a bug or failure?

(Discuss meaningful exception types like `InvalidOrderStateException`, `InsufficientStockException`, `PaymentDeclinedException`, etc., caught to drive alternate flows.)

**My Experience with Custom Exceptions:**

Yes, custom exceptions are incredibly valuable for conveying domain-specific error conditions within an application. They enhance readability, enable more precise error handling, and promote robust design.

**When a Specific Catch Block Helped Avoid a Bug/Failure:**

Consider an e-commerce order processing system.

  * **Custom Exception:** `InsufficientStockException` (derives from `Exception` or `ApplicationException`). This exception would be thrown by the inventory service if a product is out of stock when an order is being finalized.

  * **Scenario without Custom Exception:** If the inventory service just threw a generic `InvalidOperationException` or a more general `Exception`, the order processing service would catch it, but it wouldn't know *why* the operation was invalid. It might just log a generic error or show a generic "something went wrong" message.

  * **Scenario *with* Custom Exception and Specific Catch:**

    ```csharp
    // Custom Exception Definition
    public class InsufficientStockException : Exception
    {
        public string ProductSku { get; }
        public int RequestedQuantity { get; }
        public int AvailableQuantity { get; }

        public InsufficientStockException(string message, string productSku, int requested, int available)
            : base(message)
        {
            ProductSku = productSku;
            RequestedQuantity = requested;
            AvailableQuantity = available;
        }
    }

    public class OrderProcessingService
    {
        private readonly InventoryService _inventoryService = new InventoryService();

        public void ProcessOrder(Order order)
        {
            try
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"[OrderProcessing]: Processing order {order.OrderId}...");
                // Step 1: Validate and reserve stock
                foreach (var item in order.Items)
                {
                    _inventoryService.ReserveStock(item.ProductSku, item.Quantity);
                }

                // Step 2: Process payment (could throw PaymentDeclinedException)
                // Step 3: Dispatch order
                Console.WriteLine($"[OrderProcessing]: Order {order.OrderId} processed successfully.");
            }
            // Specific catch for InsufficientStockException
            catch (InsufficientStockException ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"[OrderProcessing Catch]: Specific handling for stock issue: {ex.Message}");
                Console.WriteLine($"  Product '{ex.ProductSku}' requested: {ex.RequestedQuantity}, available: {ex.AvailableQuantity}.");
                // Avoided Bug/Failure:
                // 1. User-Friendly Feedback: Immediately informs the user with precise details (which product, how much was requested vs. available).
                // 2. Alternate Flow: Automatically puts the order into a "Pending Review" status, sends a notification to inventory management, or suggests alternatives to the customer. It *doesn't* just fail generically.
                // 3. Clear Logging: Specific log entries for stock issues are easy to filter and analyze.
                // 4. Prevents Invalid State: The order doesn't get partially processed or marked complete if stock isn't available.
                HandleInsufficientStock(order, ex); // Delegate to specific handler
            }
            catch (PaymentDeclinedException ex) // Another custom exception example
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"[OrderProcessing Catch]: Payment declined for order {order.OrderId}: {ex.Message}");
                // Specific handling: Revert stock, ask user for new payment details
                HandlePaymentDeclined(order, ex);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"[OrderProcessing Catch]: An unexpected error occurred: {ex.Message}");
                LogGeneralError(order, ex); // Log for developer investigation
                // Generic error message to user, critical alert to ops
            }
        }

        private void HandleInsufficientStock(Order order, InsufficientStockException ex)
        {
            // Logic to update order status, notify customer, possibly suggest backorder/alternatives
            Console.WriteLine($"  Action: Order {order.OrderId} placed on hold due to stock issue for {ex.ProductSku}.");
        }

        private void HandlePaymentDeclined(Order order, PaymentDeclinedException ex)

        }

        private void LogGeneralError(Order order, Exception ex)

            Console.Error.WriteLine($"  [ERROR]: Unexpected error processing order {order.OrderId}: {ex.ToString()}");
            // Send to Sentry/New Relic/etc.
        }
    }

    // Dummy classes for demonstration
    public class Order { public int OrderId { get; set; } public List<OrderItem> Items { get; set; } = new List<OrderItem>(); }
    public class OrderItem { public string ProductSku { get; set; } public int Quantity { get; set; } }
    public class PaymentDeclinedException : Exception { public PaymentDeclinedException(string msg) : base(msg) { } }

        {
            if (!_stock.ContainsKey(sku) || _stock[sku] < quantity)

            Console.WriteLine($"  [Inventory]: Reserved {quantity} of {sku}. Remaining: {_stock[sku]}.");
        }
    }

        service.ProcessOrder(new Order { OrderId = 102, Items = { new OrderItem { ProductSku = "PROD002", Quantity = 10 } } }); // Will throw InsufficientStockException
    }
    ```

}

This example clearly shows how a specific `catch` block (for `InsufficientStockException`) enables precise, domain-aware error handling, preventing generic failures and allowing for specific recovery actions or alternate business flows.

### ðŸ”¹ Youâ€™re working on retry logic with Polly. How do you decide which exceptions are retryable vs non-retryable?
(Define retry policies targeting transient exceptions: `HttpRequestException`, `TimeoutException`, `SqlException` (specific error codes), `TaskCanceledException`, `SocketException`. Avoid retrying for non-transient/logic errors: `ArgumentException`, `NullReferenceException`, `NotSupportedException`, `InvalidOperationException`, `AuthenticationException`.)

**Explanation:**

Retry logic (often implemented with libraries like Polly) is designed to handle **transient faults**. These are temporary, self-correcting errors that are expected to resolve themselves within a short period (e.g., network glitches, temporary service unavailability, database connection spikes).

**Retryable Exceptions (Transient Faults):**

These are exceptions that indicate a temporary issue and are good candidates for retries.

* **Network/Connectivity Issues:**
    * `HttpRequestException`: General HTTP request errors (e.g., DNS resolution failure, connection refused).
    * `TimeoutException`: A configured operation timed out.
    * `SocketException`: Low-level network errors.
    * `TaskCanceledException` / `OperationCanceledException`: Can occur if an underlying network operation or HTTP request is cancelled mid-flight (e.g., due to a timeout or client-side cancellation).
* **Temporary Service Unavailability:**
    * Specific HTTP status codes (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error, 502 Bad Gateway, 503 Service Unavailable, 504 Gateway Timeout) returned by HTTP APIs.
    * Specific database error codes indicating temporary connection issues (e.g., certain `SqlException` error numbers for SQL Server transient errors).
* **Concurrency/Throttling:**
    * Specific HTTP status codes like 429 Too Many Requests (if the API supports a `Retry-After` header).

**Non-Retryable Exceptions (Non-Transient/Logic Errors):**

These exceptions indicate a permanent problem, a bug in the code, or a state that will not resolve itself by simply retrying. Retrying these would be futile and waste resources.

* **Input Validation Errors:**
    * `ArgumentException` (and its derivatives like `ArgumentNullException`, `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`): Indicates invalid parameters were passed to a method. Retrying won't fix bad input.
    * `FormatException`: Invalid data format.
* **Business Logic Errors:**
    * `InvalidOperationException`: An operation was attempted in an invalid state (e.g., trying to write to a closed stream).
    * `NotSupportedException`: An operation is not implemented or not allowed.
    * `AuthenticationException` / `SecurityTokenExpiredException`: Authentication/authorization failure. Retrying with the same credentials won't help unless the issue is truly transient (e.g., token refresh in progress).
* **Critical System Errors:**
    * `NullReferenceException`: A bug in your code.
    * `OutOfMemoryException`, `StackOverflowException`, `AccessViolationException`: Indicate severe application state corruption. Retrying is pointless; the application needs to fail-fast or be restarted.
* **Specific Business Rule Violations:**
    * Custom exceptions indicating a permanent business rule violation (e.g., `InsufficientFundsException` in a payment system, unless it's known to be a *transient* state).

**Code Example (using Polly):**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Polly; // Install-Package Polly

public static class RetryLogic
{
    public static async Task Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Retry Logic with Polly ---");

        // Define a retry policy for transient HTTP errors
        // This policy will retry up to 3 times, waiting 1, 2, and 4 seconds between retries
        // It will retry if it catches HttpRequestException or if the result is a 5xx status code.
        var retryPolicy = Policy
            .Handle<HttpRequestException>() // Catch network issues
            .OrResult<HttpResponseMessage>(r => r.StatusCode >= System.Net.HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError ||
                                                r.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.RequestTimeout ||
                                                r.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.TooManyRequests) // Catch server-side errors or throttling
            .WaitAndRetryAsync(3, retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, retryAttempt)),
                (exception, timeSpan, retryCount, context) =>
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"  [Retry Policy]: Retry {retryCount} after {timeSpan.TotalSeconds:N1}s. Exception/Result: {exception?.Exception?.Message ?? exception?.Result?.StatusCode.ToString()}");
                });

        // Scenario 1: Transient network error (retryable)
        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 1: Simulating transient network error.");
        try
        {
            int attemptCount = 0;
            await retryPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
            {
                attemptCount++;
                Console.WriteLine($"  [Operation]: Attempt {attemptCount} to make HTTP call.");
                if (attemptCount < 3) // Fail for first 2 attempts
                {
                    throw new HttpRequestException("Simulated network problem.");
                }
                return new HttpResponseMessage(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK); // Succeed on 3rd attempt
            });
            Console.WriteLine("  [Operation]: Transient error handled successfully.");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Operation Failed]: Failed to handle transient error: {ex.Message}");
        }

        // Scenario 2: Non-retryable error (should fail fast)
        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 2: Simulating non-retryable logic error.");
        try
        {
            await retryPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine("  [Operation]: Attempting operation with non-retryable error.");
                throw new ArgumentNullException("Input cannot be null!"); // Non-retryable
            });
            Console.WriteLine("  [Operation]: Unexpected success with non-retryable error.");
        }
        catch (ArgumentNullException ex) // This will be caught directly, as policy doesn't handle it
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Operation Failed]: Correctly caught non-retryable error: {ex.Message}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Operation Failed]: Caught unexpected error: {ex.Message}");
        }
        Console.WriteLine();

### ðŸ”¹ A generic `catch (Exception)` block is logging all exceptions globally. Is this a good practice? What are the risks?

(Risk: swallowing exceptions, blocking debugging, catching things like `StackOverflowException`, breaking fail-fast principle.)

**Is it a good practice?**

No, a bare `catch (Exception ex)` block that only logs and then allows execution to continue (without re-throwing) is generally **NOT a good practice** as a primary, widespread error handling strategy.

**What are the risks?**

1.  **Silent Swallowing of Critical Exceptions:** This is the most severe risk. As discussed, it will catch `OutOfMemoryException`, `StackOverflowException`, `AccessViolationException`, and other fundamental CLR exceptions. These exceptions indicate severe, often unrecoverable problems with the application's runtime environment or state. Silently logging them and continuing means the application might enter a corrupted state, leading to unpredictable behavior, data loss, or security vulnerabilities, rather than failing fast and predictably.
2.  **Masking Bugs:** It hides programming errors (like `NullReferenceException`, `ArgumentException`, `InvalidOperationException`) that should ideally be caught during development/testing and fixed. Instead, they become runtime logging events that don't immediately crash the application, making them harder to discover and debug.
3.  **Hiding the True Nature of the Problem:** When all exceptions are caught and logged generically, it becomes difficult to distinguish between different types of errors. The logs might become flooded with irrelevant or misleading information, making it challenging to identify patterns or the root cause of persistent issues.
4.  **Debugging Difficulties:** If an exception is swallowed, the debugger's ability to break at the point of failure is compromised. You might only see the logged message, not the full context or the precise line of code that caused the issue, forcing you to rely on less effective means of investigation.
5.  **Violating the Fail-Fast Principle:** For non-recoverable errors, the "fail-fast" principle dictates that an application should crash quickly and loudly. This prevents further damage and ensures that the problem is immediately addressed. A generic `catch` that continues execution prevents this.
6.  **Performance Overhead:** While minor, catching all exceptions adds a small performance overhead compared to only catching anticipated ones.

**When it is acceptable (and how to mitigate risks):**

A global `catch (Exception ex)` block is acceptable and often **necessary** at the **absolute top-most layer** of an application's process (e.g., in `Program.Main`, global HTTP request handlers, Windows Service error handlers, or event subscriptions for unhandled exceptions) *only if*:

  * **Purpose is Monitoring/Reporting:** Its primary purpose is to act as a last resort, ensuring that *no* exception goes unrecorded before the application terminates.
  * **Full Logging:** It *always* logs the `ex.ToString()` (full exception details including stack trace and inner exceptions).
  * **Controlled Termination/Recovery:** After logging, it performs a graceful shutdown, displays a generic user-friendly error message, and typically **allows the application to terminate** or re-throws the exception (`throw;`) to ensure the process actually exits. It does *not* silently continue normal execution.
  * **Filtering (Advanced):** In very sophisticated systems, it might combine `catch (Exception ex)` with exception filters or specific checks to re-throw (or `FailFast`) certain critical exceptions (`OutOfMemoryException`, etc.) immediately.

**In summary:** A general `catch (Exception ex)` block for global logging is a vital safety net, but it should be seen as a **last line of defense** for unrecoverable errors, not a primary error-handling strategy that allows execution to continue. For specific, recoverable errors, always use specific `catch` blocks.
