Method Overriding and Method Hiding are two distinct mechanisms in object-oriented programming (particularly in C\# and Java) that deal with how methods behave in an inheritance hierarchy when a derived class defines a method with the same signature as a method in its base class.

Let's explain them with C\# code examples, as it explicitly uses keywords like `virtual`, `override`, and `new` which makes the distinction clearer.

## Method Overriding (Polymorphism)

**Concept:**
Method overriding allows a derived class to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its base class. The key here is **polymorphism**: when you call an overridden method on an object, the runtime type of the object determines which implementation (base or derived) is executed.

**Keywords:**

  * **`virtual` (in Base Class):** This keyword modifies a method, property, indexer, or event declaration and enables it to be overridden in a derived class. If a member is not marked `virtual`, it cannot be overridden.
  * **`override` (in Derived Class):** This keyword is used in a derived class to explicitly indicate that a method is providing a new implementation for a `virtual` (or `abstract`) member inherited from its base class.

**Behavior:**

  * **Runtime Resolution:** The decision of which method to call is made at *runtime* based on the actual type of the object, not the compile-time type of the reference variable.
  * **Polymorphic Behavior:** If you have a base class reference variable pointing to a derived class object, calling the overridden method will execute the derived class's implementation.

**When to Use:**
When you want to enable polymorphic behavior, where different derived types can provide their own specific implementations for a common operation defined in the base class. This is fundamental to object-oriented design (e.g., `Shape.Draw()`, `Animal.MakeSound()`).

**C\# Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

// Base class with a virtual method
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound() // Marked as virtual
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

// Derived class overriding the virtual method
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound() // Uses 'override' keyword
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks!");
    }
}

// Another derived class overriding the virtual method
public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound() // Uses 'override' keyword
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cat meows!");
    }
}

public class OverridingExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
        myAnimal.MakeSound(); // Output: Animal makes a sound.

        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.MakeSound();    // Output: Dog barks!

        Cat myCat = new Cat();
        myCat.MakeSound();    // Output: Cat meows!

        // Polymorphic behavior: The actual type of the object determines the method called
        Animal genericDog = new Dog(); // Animal reference, but Dog object
        genericDog.MakeSound();       // Output: Dog barks! (Runtime determines it's a Dog)

        Animal genericCat = new Cat(); // Animal reference, but Cat object
        genericCat.MakeSound();       // Output: Cat meows! (Runtime determines it's a Cat)

        // What if we try to treat a Dog as an Animal and then cast back?
        // Still calls the overridden method.
        Animal anotherGenericDog = new Dog();
        ((Dog)anotherGenericDog).MakeSound(); // Output: Dog barks!
    }
}
```

**IL Differences (Simplified):**

When `virtual` and `override` are used, the Intermediate Language (IL) for the method call will typically involve an instruction like `callvirt` (Call Virtual Method). This instruction tells the Common Language Runtime (CLR) to look up the method in the object's *virtual method table* at runtime to find the correct implementation based on the object's actual type.

For `myAnimal.MakeSound();` (where `myAnimal` is `new Animal()`):
`callvirt instance void Animal::MakeSound()`

For `genericDog.MakeSound();` (where `genericDog` is `new Dog()` but referenced as `Animal`):
`callvirt instance void Animal::MakeSound()`
Despite the reference type being `Animal`, `callvirt` ensures that if `Dog` has an overridden implementation, it will be called.

## Method Hiding (Shadowing / New Method)

**Concept:**
Method hiding (also known as shadowing) occurs when a derived class defines a new method with the *same signature* (name and parameters) as a method in its base class, but the base class method was **not** marked `virtual`. The `new` keyword is used in C\# to explicitly indicate that you intend to hide the base class method. If `new` is omitted, the compiler will issue a warning.

**Keywords:**

  * **`new` (in Derived Class):** This keyword explicitly states that you are creating a *new* method in the derived class that happens to have the same signature as a base class method, effectively "hiding" the base class method from the derived class's scope.

**Behavior:**

  * **Compile-Time Resolution:** The decision of which method to call is made at *compile-time* based on the *reference type* of the variable, not the actual runtime type of the object.
  * **No Polymorphism:** Method hiding does not exhibit polymorphic behavior. If you have a base class reference variable pointing to a derived class object, calling the hidden method will execute the base class's implementation. You must cast the reference to the derived type to access the derived class's hidden method.

**When to Use:**
When you want to introduce a new method in a derived class that coincidentally has the same name as a base class method, but you **don't want to change the behavior of the base class method for polymorphic calls**. This is less common in good object-oriented design and can sometimes lead to confusion if not used carefully. It's often used when you are extending a legacy library and cannot modify the base class to make a method `virtual`.

**C\# Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

// Base class without a virtual method
public class BaseClass
{
    public void DisplayMessage() // Not virtual
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Message from BaseClass.");
    }

    public void CommonMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Common method from BaseClass.");
    }
}

// Derived class hiding the base class method
public class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    // Uses 'new' keyword to hide the base class method
    public new void DisplayMessage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Message from DerivedClass (hiding BaseClass).");
    }

    // This method does not hide anything, it's just a new method in DerivedClass
    public void NewMethodInDerived()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("New method specific to DerivedClass.");
    }

    // You can still call the base class's hidden method explicitly
    public void CallBaseDisplayMessage()
    {
        base.DisplayMessage(); // Calls the hidden base method
    }
}

public class HidingExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        BaseClass baseObj = new BaseClass();
        baseObj.DisplayMessage(); // Output: Message from BaseClass.

        DerivedClass derivedObj = new DerivedClass();
        derivedObj.DisplayMessage(); // Output: Message from DerivedClass (hiding BaseClass).

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Demonstrating Hiding Behavior ---");

        // When referenced by the BaseClass type, the BaseClass method is called
        BaseClass baseRefToDerived = new DerivedClass();
        baseRefToDerived.DisplayMessage(); // Output: Message from BaseClass.
                                           // (Compile-time type of baseRefToDerived is BaseClass)

        // To call the hidden method in DerivedClass, you must cast
        ((DerivedClass)baseRefToDerived).DisplayMessage(); // Output: Message from DerivedClass (hiding BaseClass).

        // You can still access the common method that wasn't hidden
        baseRefToDerived.CommonMethod(); // Output: Common method from BaseClass.
    }
}
```

**IL Differences (Simplified):**

When method hiding is used, the IL for the method call will typically use an instruction like `call` (Call Method) instead of `callvirt`. This instruction tells the CLR to call the method directly based on the *compile-time type* of the reference, without performing a runtime lookup in the virtual method table.

For `baseObj.DisplayMessage();` (where `baseObj` is `new BaseClass()`):
`call instance void BaseClass::DisplayMessage()`

For `baseRefToDerived.DisplayMessage();` (where `baseRefToDerived` is `new DerivedClass()` but referenced as `BaseClass`):
`call instance void BaseClass::DisplayMessage()`
Here, even though the actual object is `DerivedClass`, the `call` instruction (due to `BaseClass` not being `virtual`) makes the compile-time type (`BaseClass`) determine which method is invoked.

## When to Hide vs. Override

**When to Override (`virtual`/`override`):**

  * **Polymorphism is required:** This is the most common and powerful use case. When you want to treat objects of different derived types uniformly through a base class reference, but have them exhibit their specific behaviors.
  * **Extending base class functionality:** When a base class provides a default behavior, and derived classes need to specialize or extend that behavior while still maintaining the base contract.
  * **Abstract methods:** If the base class defines an `abstract` method, derived classes *must* `override` it to provide a concrete implementation.
  * **Good Object-Oriented Design:** Overriding is central to achieving flexible and extensible designs.

**When to Hide (`new`):**

  * **Accidental Naming Conflict:** If you're developing a derived class and you coincidentally use a method name that already exists in the base class, but you *don't* intend to override it (i.e., you don't want polymorphic behavior, or the base method isn't `virtual`). The `new` keyword signals your intent to the compiler and suppresses the warning.
  * **Extending a Sealed Class or Third-Party Library:** If you're inheriting from a class that you cannot modify (e.g., a `sealed` class in C\#, a `final` class in Java, or a class from a third-party library) and a base method is *not* `virtual`, but you need a method with the same signature in your derived class, hiding is your only option.
  * **Introducing a Completely New Concept:** In rare cases, a derived class might introduce a method that conceptually has the same name as a base method but performs a fundamentally different operation, and you want to ensure no accidental polymorphic calls. However, this often signals a potential design flaw and might be better handled by renaming the method or rethinking the hierarchy.

**General Recommendation:**

In most object-oriented designs, **prefer method overriding** (`virtual`/`override`) over method hiding (`new`). Method overriding promotes polymorphism, which is a cornerstone of flexible and extensible systems. Method hiding can lead to confusing behavior, especially when dealing with base class references, and often indicates a less robust design. Use `new` only when overriding is not possible or desirable for a very specific, well-understood reason.
