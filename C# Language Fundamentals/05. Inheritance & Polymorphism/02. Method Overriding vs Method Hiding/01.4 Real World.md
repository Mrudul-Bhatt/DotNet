Let's tackle these scenarios involving method hiding and overriding in multi-level hierarchies and API design.

### 1\. In a multi-level class hierarchy, someone uses `new` instead of `override` and a bug appears. How would you diagnose and fix it?

This is a classic bug stemming from a misunderstanding of polymorphism.

**Scenario:**
Imagine a hierarchy:
`Animal` (has `virtual void MakeSound()`)
`Dog : Animal` (correctly `override void MakeSound()`)
`Poodle : Dog` (incorrectly uses `public new void MakeSound()`)

The bug appears when someone writes code like this:

```csharp
List<Animal> pets = new List<Animal>();
pets.Add(new Dog());
pets.Add(new Poodle());

foreach (Animal pet in pets)
{
    pet.MakeSound(); // The bug is here for Poodle!
}
```

**Expected Output:**
Dog barks\!
Poodle yaps\!

**Actual Output:**
Dog barks\!
Dog barks\! (or potentially "Animal makes a sound\!" if `Dog` also hid `MakeSound()`)

The `Poodle` object, when referenced as an `Animal` or `Dog`, calls the `Dog`'s (or `Animal`'s) `MakeSound()` method instead of its own, because `Poodle`'s `MakeSound()` method *hides* rather than *overrides*.

**Diagnosis:**

1.  **Symptom Observation:** The first clue is that the program's output or behavior is not what's expected for objects of the derived class when they are accessed through a base class reference. In our example, the Poodle is barking instead of yapping.
2.  **Code Review (Targeted):** If the symptom points to a specific method call, I'd review the class hierarchy for that method (`MakeSound()` in this case).
      * Look for the `virtual` keyword in the base class (`Animal`).
      * Look for the `override` keyword in intermediate derived classes (`Dog`).
      * Crucially, look for the `new` keyword (or absence of `override` and `new`, which still causes hiding) in the lowest-level derived class (`Poodle`).
3.  **Compiler Warnings:** If the code was compiled with warnings enabled, there would have been a warning: "'Poodle.MakeSound()' hides inherited member 'Dog.MakeSound()'. Use the new keyword if hiding was intended." This is often the quickest way to spot it during development, but it can be missed or suppressed.
4.  **Debugging (Runtime Inspection):**
      * Set a breakpoint on the `pet.MakeSound()` line within the loop.
      * When `pet` is a `Poodle` instance, step into the `MakeSound()` call.
      * If it jumps to `Dog.MakeSound()` (or `Animal.MakeSound()`) instead of `Poodle.MakeSound()`, that's concrete proof of hiding.
      * Examine the object's runtime type and the method being invoked.
5.  **Reflector/Decompiler (for compiled code):** If working with a compiled assembly (e.g., a bug report from a production environment where you only have binaries), tools like ILSpy or dotPeek can decompile the code. You can then inspect the C\# keywords (`virtual`, `override`, `new`) to confirm the hiding. You'd also look at the IL instructions: `call` for hidden methods, `callvirt` for overridden ones.

**Fix:**

Assuming the intent was polymorphism (which is almost always the case when dealing with `virtual` methods higher up the chain):

1.  **Modify the Derived Class:** Change the `new` keyword (or the default behavior if no keyword was used) in the `Poodle` class to `override`.
    ```csharp
    public class Poodle : Dog
    {
        // OLD: public new void MakeSound()
        public override void MakeSound() // Fix: Change 'new' to 'override'
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Poodle yaps!");
        }
    }
    ```
2.  **Verify Hierarchy:** Ensure that all methods in the inheritance chain that are intended to be part of the polymorphic behavior are correctly marked `virtual` in the base and `override` in derived classes. If `Dog.MakeSound()` wasn't `override` (and `Animal.MakeSound()` was `virtual`), the issue would propagate.
3.  **Retest:** Thoroughly retest the affected functionality, specifically using base class references to ensure the correct derived method is now being called polymorphically.

### 2\. Your API library exposes a base class. A consumer overrides it incorrectly. How would you make the design clearer or more error-proof?

This is about API design for extensibility. When you expose a base class, you're inviting consumers to extend it, so guiding them to do it correctly is key.

**Making the Design Clearer:**

1.  **Explicit Documentation:** This is paramount.

      * **Method-level XML Comments:** For every `virtual` or `abstract` method that you expect consumers to override, use clear XML comments (`/// <summary>`, `/// <remarks>`).
          * Explain its purpose.
          * Describe when/why it should be overridden.
          * Specify whether `base.Method()` should be called and when (e.g., "Call `base.Initialize()` first to ensure core setup is complete.").
          * Clearly state what the default behavior is if not overridden.
      * **Class-level Documentation:** Explain the overall extensibility model of the base class.
      * **Developer Guides/Tutorials:** Provide concrete code examples of correct overriding and common pitfalls.

2.  **Meaningful Method Naming:**

      * If a method is intended as an extension point, its name can suggest that.
      * Example: `On[Something]`, `Do[Something]Core`, `Provide[Data]`.
      * If `Initialize()` is meant for extension, keep it simple. If a core logic method, maybe `ExecuteLogic()` (and make `virtual`).

3.  **Design by Contract (Abstract Base Classes/Interfaces):**

      * If a method *must* be implemented by a consumer, make it `abstract`. This forces the `override` and prevents hiding.
      * If the base class is primarily a contract for extension, consider making it `abstract` itself.

**Making the Design More Error-Proof (Preventing Incorrect Overrides):**

1.  **Use `abstract` where mandatory:** As mentioned, if a derived class *must* provide an implementation, make the base method `abstract`. This eliminates the possibility of hiding because abstract methods *cannot* be hidden; they *must* be overridden. The compiler enforces this.

    ```csharp
    // Before (prone to hiding)
    public class ApiBase { public void DoStuff() { /* default */ } }
    public class ConsumerDerived : ApiBase { public new void DoStuff() { /* oops */ } }

    // After (error-proofed for mandatory implementation)
    public abstract class ApiBase { public abstract void DoStuff(); } // Forces override
    public class ConsumerDerived : ApiBase { public override void DoStuff() { /* must override */ } }
    ```

2.  **Mark methods `sealed` where no further overriding is allowed:** If a base class method has already overridden another method in a hierarchy, and you don't want consumers (or subsequent derived classes) to override *that specific implementation*, mark it `sealed override`.

    ```csharp
    public class Grandparent { public virtual void Act() { /* ... */ } }
    public class Parent : Grandparent { public sealed override void Act() { /* cannot be overridden further */ } }
    // public class Child : Parent { public override void Act() { /* ERROR: Cannot override sealed method */ } }
    ```

3.  **Discourage Inheritance (Composition over Inheritance):**

      * For many scenarios, designing your API to use **composition** rather than deep inheritance hierarchies can be more robust.
      * Instead of consumers inheriting your base class, they might implement an interface you provide, and then you inject their implementation into your API classes. This completely avoids overriding/hiding issues.
      * **Example:** Instead of `ApiBase` with `virtual DoStuff()`, provide `IStuffDoer` interface. Your `ApiExecutor` takes an `IStuffDoer`.
        ```csharp
        // Instead of this:
        // public class ApiBase { public virtual void Process() { /* ... */ } }
        // public class MyApiImplementation : ApiBase { public override void Process() { /* ... */ } }

        // Consider this:
        public interface IProcessor { void Process(); } // Define contract
        public class DefaultProcessor : IProcessor { public void Process() { /* ... */ } } // Default impl
        public class MyCustomProcessor : IProcessor { public void Process() { /* ... */ } } // Consumer's impl

        public class ApiService
        {
            private readonly IProcessor _processor;
            public ApiService(IProcessor processor) { _processor = processor; }
            public void Execute() { _processor.Process(); }
        }

        // Usage:
        // new ApiService(new MyCustomProcessor()).Execute();
        ```
      * This makes the contract explicit via the interface and completely bypasses the complexities of inheritance for core extensibility.

4.  **Static Analysis Tools & Guidelines:**

      * In your team's development practices, enforce the use of static analysis tools (like Roslyn Analyzers, SonarQube rules) that flag common API misuse patterns, including incorrect use of `new` vs. `override`.
      * Publish clear internal coding guidelines for API development that explicitly address inheritance and polymorphism best practices.

### 3\. You inherit a class that contains methods you want to override, but they are not marked `virtual`. What are your options?

This is a common legacy code or third-party library scenario. If the method isn't `virtual`, you *cannot* truly override it.

Here are your options, from most preferred to least:

1.  **Option 1: Request a Change to the Base Class (If Possible and Justified)**

      * **Feasibility:** Only if you own the base class's source code or can influence its maintainers (e.g., open-source project contribution).
      * **Approach:** Explain why the method should be `virtual` (e.g., to enable polymorphism, facilitate extensibility for common use cases).
      * **Pros:** The cleanest, most correct, and truly polymorphic solution.
      * **Cons:** Might not be possible due to external library, lack of ownership, or maintainer resistance.

2.  **Option 2: Use the Adapter/Wrapper Pattern (Strongly Recommended for New Code/External Libraries)**

      * **Feasibility:** Always possible.
      * **Approach:**
          * Create a **new interface** (`IMyCustomFeature`) that defines the behavior you *want* to achieve (including the method you originally wanted to override).
          * Create **your own concrete class** that implements this `IMyCustomFeature` interface.
          * Inside your concrete class, you will **contain an instance of the legacy class**.
          * Your implementation of the interface method will call the legacy class's method if appropriate, but *then add your custom logic*, or completely replace it.
      * **Pros:**
          * Decouples your new code from the legacy class's limitations.
          * Achieves polymorphism through your own interface.
          * Enhances testability of your new code.
          * Prevents directly inheriting problematic aspects of the legacy class.
      * **Cons:** Adds an extra layer of abstraction.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    // Legacy class (cannot modify)
    public class LegacyReporter {
        public void GenerateReport() { Console.WriteLine("Legacy: Generating standard report."); }
        public void SaveReport() { Console.WriteLine("Legacy: Saving standard report."); }
    }

    // Your new interface
    public interface ICustomReporter {
        void CreateAndStoreReport();
    }

    // Your adapter/wrapper
    public class MyAdaptedReporter : ICustomReporter {
        private LegacyReporter _legacyReporter;

        public MyAdaptedReporter() {
            _legacyReporter = new LegacyReporter();
        }

        public void CreateAndStoreReport() {
            _legacyReporter.GenerateReport(); // Call the base method that couldn't be overridden
            Console.WriteLine("MyAdapter: Adding custom data to report.");
            _legacyReporter.SaveReport();
            Console.WriteLine("MyAdapter: Uploading report to cloud storage."); // Your new logic
        }
    }

    // New code uses ICustomReporter for polymorphism
    // ICustomReporter reporter = new MyAdaptedReporter();
    // reporter.CreateAndStoreReport();
    ```

3.  **Option 3: Method Hiding (`new` keyword)**

      * **Feasibility:** Always possible.
      * **Approach:** Define a method with the exact same signature in your derived class and use the `new` keyword.
      * **Pros:** Simple to implement. Suppresses the compiler warning.
      * **Cons:** **Does not provide polymorphism.** This is the critical downside. If your code accesses the derived object through a base class reference, the base class's method will *still* be called, leading to subtle bugs. It can also lead to confusion for future developers.
      * **When to use:** Only when you *truly* intend to introduce a completely new method that happens to have the same name, and you are absolutely certain that this method will *never* be called polymorphically through the base class reference. This is rare and generally discouraged.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public class LegacyComponent {
        public void Process() { Console.WriteLine("Legacy Component Processing"); }
    }

    public class MyNewComponent : LegacyComponent {
        public new void Process() { // Hides LegacyComponent.Process()
            Console.WriteLine("My New Component Processing");
            // You can call base.Process() if you want to extend it
            // base.Process();
        }
    }

    // Problematic usage:
    // LegacyComponent comp = new MyNewComponent();
    // comp.Process(); // Still calls LegacyComponent.Process()!
    ```

4.  **Option 4: New Method with a Different Name**

      * **Feasibility:** Always possible.
      * **Approach:** Simply create a new method in your derived class with a *different name* that performs the desired custom logic.
      * **Pros:** Clear, no ambiguity, no compiler warnings.
      * **Cons:** Doesn't directly replace the base method's functionality in the same conceptual slot. You have to remember to call your new method.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public class LegacyCalculator {
        public int Add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
    }

    public class AdvancedCalculator : LegacyCalculator {
        public int CustomAdd(int a, int b) { // New name
            // Add custom logic, maybe call base.Add if needed
            return base.Add(a, b) * 2;
        }
    }
    ```

### 4\. Your system has a generic base class with logging functionality. A junior developer hides the log method. How do you review or refactor that?

This is a very common scenario. Hiding a logging method is problematic because you usually want *all* derived components to log consistently, or to direct logs to a central system polymorphically.

**Scenario:**

```csharp
public class BaseLoggerComponent
{
    public void Log(string message) // Not virtual
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[Base Logger] {message}");
        // Imagine complex file I/O, network sending, etc.
    }
}

public class MyService : BaseLoggerComponent
{
    // Junior developer's change:
    public new void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[MyService] DEBUG: {message}");
        // They forgot to call base.Log() or didn't understand the implication
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        Log("Doing something important.");
    }
}

// Problematic usage:
public class MainApp
{
    public static void main(string[] args)
    {
        BaseLoggerComponent service = new MyService();
        service.Log("Application startup."); // This calls BaseLoggerComponent.Log()
        ((MyService)service).DoSomething(); // This calls MyService.Log()
    }
}
```

The bug here is that `Application startup.` might not be logged by the full-fledged base logger, or worse, `MyService.Log()` might not send the log to the central system as the `BaseLoggerComponent` intended. The behavior depends entirely on the *reference type*.

**Review Process:**

1.  **Code Review:**

      * **The `new` keyword:** The presence of `new` on a method that exists in the base class is an immediate red flag.
      * **Missing `override`:** If the base method wasn't `virtual`, but the new method has the same signature, the compiler warning about hiding would be prominent. I'd ask why `new` was used or why the warning wasn't addressed.
      * **Intent vs. Reality:** Ask the junior developer: "What was your goal here? Did you intend for `MyService` to have its *own separate* logging method, or did you want to customize how `BaseLoggerComponent` logs?"
      * **Polymorphic Use Cases:** Consider how the `Log` method might be called in the system. If there's any scenario where `MyService` might be referenced as a `BaseLoggerComponent`, then hiding is likely wrong.

2.  **Test Case Analysis:**

      * If unit tests exist for `MyService`, do they test the `Log` method behavior (especially when called via `BaseLoggerComponent` reference)?
      * If integration tests cover components using the logging, check the actual log output – is it missing entries or routing incorrectly?

**Refactoring/Fixing:**

The ideal fix depends on the *desired logging behavior*:

1.  **If the Derived Class Needs to *Customize* Base Logging (Most Common):**

      * **Make Base Method `virtual`:** If possible, modify `BaseLoggerComponent.Log` to be `virtual`.
        ```csharp
        public class BaseLoggerComponent
        {
            public virtual void Log(string message) // Mark as virtual
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"[Base Logger] {message}");
            }
        }
        ```
      * **Change Derived to `override`:** Then, in `MyService`, change `new` to `override`. The derived method can then call `base.Log()` to extend the base logging behavior, or completely replace it if that's the intent.
        ```csharp
        public class MyService : BaseLoggerComponent
        {
            public override void Log(string message) // Change to override
            {
                base.Log(message); // Call base to ensure central logging
                Console.WriteLine($"[MyService] DEBUG: {message}"); // Add specific debug info
            }
        }
        ```
      * **Why this is preferred:** This preserves polymorphism. Any code expecting a `BaseLoggerComponent` can call `Log`, and the derived class's customization will correctly apply.

2.  **If the Derived Class Needs a *Completely Different* Logging Mechanism (Rare & Discouraged for core logging):**

      * **Rename the Method:** If the `Log` method in `MyService` is truly independent and not meant to be a specialization of the base `Log` (e.g., it's logging to a *different* system, for a different *purpose*), then it should have a different name. This avoids all confusion.
        ```csharp
        public class MyService : BaseLoggerComponent
        {
            public void MyServiceSpecificLog(string message) // Renamed
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"[MyService] SPECIAL LOG: {message}");
            }
            // Retain base.Log() for generic logging if needed
            // public void Log(string message) { base.Log(message); }
        }
        ```
      * **Consider Composition:** For fundamentally different logging, `MyService` could *compose* an `ILogger` interface (using Dependency Injection) instead of inheriting specific logging functionality.

**Key Takeaway for Reviewers:**
Always question the use of `new`. It's a strong signal that polymorphism might be desired but incorrectly implemented, or that the design needs clearer separation of concerns.

### 5\. In a polymorphic collection of base class references, how can hiding lead to unexpected behavior? How do you prevent it?

This is the core problem that method hiding causes when polymorphism is desired.

**Scenario:**

```csharp
public class Worker // Base class, method not virtual
{
    public void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Worker is doing generic work.");
    }
}

public class Manager : Worker // Derived class hides Work()
{
    public new void Work() // Hides Worker.Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Manager is managing tasks.");
    }
}

public class Engineer : Worker // Another derived class hides Work()
{
    public new void Work() // Hides Worker.Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Engineer is writing code.");
    }
}

public class TeamMeeting
{
    public static void ConductMeeting(List<Worker> teamMembers)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Team Meeting ---");
        foreach (Worker member in teamMembers) // Polymorphic collection (Base class references)
        {
            member.Work(); // This is where the unexpected behavior occurs
        }
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<Worker> team = new List<Worker>();
        team.Add(new Worker());
        team.Add(new Manager());
        team.Add(new Engineer());

        ConductMeeting(team);
    }
}
```

**Expected Behavior (if polymorphism were working):**
\--- Team Meeting ---
Worker is doing generic work.
Manager is managing tasks.
Engineer is writing code.

**Actual Behavior (due to hiding):**
\--- Team Meeting ---
Worker is doing generic work.
Worker is doing generic work. // Manager object, but Base Worker method called
Worker is doing generic work. // Engineer object, but Base Worker method called

**How Hiding Leads to Unexpected Behavior:**

1.  **Compile-Time Resolution:** When `member.Work()` is called inside the `foreach` loop, the compiler sees `member` as a `Worker` type (the reference type in the `List<Worker>`). Since `Worker.Work()` is *not* `virtual`, the compiler binds the call to `Worker.Work()` at compile-time.
2.  **Loss of Polymorphism:** Even though `member` might actually point to a `Manager` or `Engineer` object at runtime, the compile-time decision dictates which method is invoked. The runtime type of the object is ignored for method dispatch.
3.  **Inconsistent Behavior:** This means that objects of derived classes (`Manager`, `Engineer`) do not exhibit their specialized behavior (`managing tasks`, `writing code`) when accessed through a base class reference (`Worker`), leading to bugs where the system believes generic work is being done by everyone, rather than their specific roles.

**How to Prevent It:**

The fundamental solution is to **enable polymorphism** when that is the desired behavior for a base class method.

1.  **Use `virtual` and `override`:**

      * **Mark the Base Method `virtual`:** This is the essential step. It explicitly signals that this method is designed to be overridden by derived classes and participate in polymorphic dispatch.
        ```csharp
        public class Worker // Base class
        {
            public virtual void Work() // Mark as virtual
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Worker is doing generic work.");
            }
        }
        ```
      * **Use `override` in Derived Classes:** Ensure that all derived classes that intend to specialize this method correctly use the `override` keyword. This forces the compiler to ensure the method signature matches and that you are indeed overriding a virtual method.
        ```csharp
        public class Manager : Worker // Derived class
        {
            public override void Work() // Change to override
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Manager is managing tasks.");
            }
        }

        public class Engineer : Worker // Derived class
        {
            public override void Work() // Change to override
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Engineer is writing code.");
            }
        }
        ```
      * **Result:** Now, when `ConductMeeting` iterates through the `List<Worker>`, `member.Work()` will correctly call `Manager.Work()` and `Engineer.Work()` at runtime because of the `virtual` dispatch mechanism.

2.  **Use `abstract` if Implementation is Mandatory:**

      * If there's no meaningful default implementation for `Work()` in `Worker`, or if every derived class *must* provide its own unique `Work()` behavior, make the `Worker` class `abstract` and `Work()` an `abstract` method. This *forces* derived classes to `override` it.
        ```csharp
        public abstract class Worker // Abstract base class
        {
            public abstract void Work(); // Abstract method (must be overridden)
        }
        ```

3.  **Strong Code Review and Static Analysis:**

      * As discussed previously, robust code review processes and static analysis tools can catch incorrect `new` usage or omitted `override` keywords before they lead to runtime bugs.

In essence, if you want your objects to behave differently based on their *actual type* when referenced by a common base type (i.e., you want polymorphism), you *must* use `virtual`/`override` (or `abstract`/`override`). Method hiding is for completely separate, coincidentally named methods, and should be used with extreme caution to avoid undermining the expected polymorphic behavior of your class hierarchy.
