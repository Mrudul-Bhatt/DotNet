Let's explore method overriding and hiding, the roles of `virtual`, `override`, and `new`, and the implications for polymorphism.

### 1\. What is method overriding in C\#? How is it different from method hiding?

**Method Overriding:**

Method overriding is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where a derived class provides a **specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its base class**. The key characteristic is that it establishes a polymorphic relationship, meaning when the method is called through a base class reference, the *derived class's implementation* is executed if the object is actually an instance of the derived class.

  * **Key Property:** Achieves polymorphism (runtime binding).
  * **Requirements:**
      * The method in the base class must be marked with the `virtual` keyword.
      * The method in the derived class must be marked with the `override` keyword.
      * The method signatures (name, return type, parameters) must be identical.
      * Access modifiers must be the same or more permissive (e.g., `protected` in base can be `public` in derived, but not `private`).

**Method Hiding (or Method Shadowing):**

Method hiding is a mechanism where a derived class defines a new method with the **same name and signature as a method in its base class**, but it does **not** override the base method. Instead, it creates a *new, separate method* within the derived class that effectively "hides" the base method when accessed through a reference of the derived type.

  * **Key Property:** Does *not* achieve polymorphism (compile-time binding).
  * **Requirements:**
      * The method in the derived class has the same name and signature as a base method.
      * It typically uses the `new` keyword (though it's optional, but highly recommended, to suppress a compiler warning).
      * The base method does not need to be `virtual`.

**Key Differences Summarized:**

| Feature            | Method Overriding (`virtual`/`override`)                  | Method Hiding (`new` keyword)                               |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Polymorphism** | **Yes (Runtime Polymorphism/Binding)**: The actual type of the object determines which method is called. | **No (Compile-Time Polymorphism/Binding)**: The declared type of the variable determines which method is called. |
| **Keywords** | `virtual` (base), `override` (derived)                    | `new` (derived) - optional but recommended                  |
| **Relationship** | **"Is-a" refinement**: Derived class provides a specialized version of the *same* method. | **"Has-a" new method**: Derived class introduces a *new* method that happens to have the same signature. |
| **Base Method** | Must be `virtual` or `abstract`.                          | Can be any method (virtual, non-virtual, static).           |
| **Compiler Check** | Compiler ensures signature match and `virtual`/`override` pairing. | Compiler warns if `new` is missing, but otherwise treats it as a new method. |
| **Purpose** | To change the behavior of an inherited method while maintaining its contract. | To define a new method in a derived class that coincidentally has the same name as a base method, effectively shadowing the base method. |

### 2\. What is the purpose of the `virtual`, `override`, and `new` keywords in C\#?

  * **`virtual` (on Base Class Method):**

      * **Purpose:** The `virtual` keyword on a method in a base class signals that this method is designed to be **overridden** by derived classes. It tells the compiler that at runtime, the appropriate method implementation (either the base or an overridden derived version) should be chosen based on the *actual type* of the object, not the declared type of the variable.
      * **Effect:** Enables polymorphism. If not marked `virtual`, the method cannot be overridden.

  * **`override` (on Derived Class Method):**

      * **Purpose:** The `override` keyword on a method in a derived class explicitly states that this method is providing a **new implementation for a `virtual` (or `abstract`) method inherited from its base class**.
      * **Effect:** The compiler strictly checks that a matching `virtual` or `abstract` method exists in the base class. It establishes the polymorphic link. If you try to `override` a non-`virtual` method, it's a compile-time error.

  * **`new` (on Derived Class Method):**

      * **Purpose:** The `new` keyword on a method in a derived class signals that this method is **intentionally hiding** a method with the same name and signature in the base class. It indicates that you are aware of the name collision and intend to create a *new* method specific to the derived class, rather than overriding the base method.
      * **Effect:** It suppresses a compiler warning that would otherwise appear when a method in a derived class hides a base method without using `new`. It clarifies your intent and improves code readability. If `new` is omitted, the hiding still occurs, but you get a warning.

### 3\. What happens if you don't use the `new` keyword when hiding a method in a derived class?

If you don't use the `new` keyword when a derived class method hides a base class method (i.e., they have the same name and signature, and the base method is not `virtual`), the method hiding **still occurs**.

However, the C\# compiler will issue a **compiler warning** (e.g., " 'DerivedClass.MethodName()' hides inherited member 'BaseClass.MethodName()'. Use the new keyword if hiding was intended.").

**Why a warning?**

The warning is there to alert you to a potential unintended consequence. Without `new`, it's ambiguous whether you:

1.  Forgot to use `override` (meaning you *intended* polymorphism, but the base method wasn't `virtual`).
2.  Unintentionally created a new method that happens to conflict with a base method.
3.  Actually *intended* to hide the base method, but just didn't explicitly state it.

Using the `new` keyword removes this ambiguity for the compiler and for other developers reading your code, making your intent explicit.

### 4\. Can a non-`virtual` method be overridden? Why or why not?

**No, a non-`virtual` method cannot be overridden in C\#.**

**Why not?**

  * **Static (Compile-Time) Binding:** When a method is not marked `virtual`, the C\# compiler performs **static binding** (also known as compile-time binding or early binding). This means the decision of which method implementation to call is made at compile time, based solely on the *declared type* of the variable.
  * **No Polymorphic Hook:** A non-`virtual` method does not provide the "hook" or "extension point" necessary for polymorphism. It explicitly tells the compiler, "This implementation is final; derived classes should not change its behavior when accessed polymorphically."
  * **`override` Requires `virtual`:** The `override` keyword specifically requires a `virtual` or `abstract` method in the base class to override. If you try to use `override` on a method that isn't `virtual` in the base, you'll get a compile-time error.

If you create a method in a derived class with the same signature as a non-`virtual` base method, it will result in **method hiding**, not overriding.

### 5\. What is the output when a derived class hides a base class method and is accessed via base reference?

When a derived class hides a base class method, and you access it via a **base class reference**, the **base class's method implementation** will be executed.

This is the core characteristic that distinguishes method hiding from overriding and demonstrates compile-time binding.

**Example:**

```csharp
public class BasePrinter
{
    public void Print() // Non-virtual method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Base: Printing a document.");
    }
}

public class DerivedPrinter : BasePrinter
{
    public new void Print() // Hides BasePrinter.Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Derived: Printing a custom document.");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // 1. Access via Derived Class Reference
        DerivedPrinter dp = new DerivedPrinter();
        dp.Print(); // Output: Derived: Printing a custom document.
                     // (Compiler chooses DerivedPrinter's Print because 'dp' is declared as DerivedPrinter)

        Console.WriteLine("---");

        // 2. Access via Base Class Reference
        BasePrinter bp = new DerivedPrinter(); // Object is DerivedPrinter, but reference is BasePrinter
        bp.Print(); // Output: Base: Printing a document.
                     // (Compiler chooses BasePrinter's Print because 'bp' is declared as BasePrinter)
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

  * In `dp.Print()`, the variable `dp` is declared as `DerivedPrinter`. The compiler sees that `DerivedPrinter` has its own `Print()` method and binds the call to that method at compile time.
  * In `bp.Print()`, the variable `bp` is declared as `BasePrinter`. Since `BasePrinter.Print()` is not `virtual`, the compiler performs static binding and decides at compile time to call `BasePrinter.Print()`. The actual runtime type of the object (`DerivedPrinter`) is irrelevant for this call because polymorphism is not enabled.

### 6\. Is method hiding polymorphic in nature? Why or why not?

**No, method hiding is explicitly NOT polymorphic in nature.**

**Why not?**

The essence of polymorphism (specifically, runtime polymorphism or dynamic dispatch) is that the method executed is determined by the **actual runtime type of the object**, not by the compile-time declared type of the variable holding the reference.

Method hiding, however, relies on **compile-time binding (static binding)**:

  * When you hide a method, the compiler decides which method to call based on the **declared type of the variable** used to invoke the method.
  * The actual type of the object stored in that variable is ignored for method calls that are hidden.

**Consider the example again:**

```csharp
BasePrinter bp = new DerivedPrinter(); // Object type: DerivedPrinter, Declared type: BasePrinter
bp.Print(); // Calls BasePrinter.Print()
```

If method hiding were polymorphic, `bp.Print()` would execute `DerivedPrinter.Print()` because the *actual object* is `DerivedPrinter`. But it doesn't. It executes `BasePrinter.Print()` because the *declared type of the variable* `bp` is `BasePrinter`.

This behavior directly contradicts the definition of polymorphism, which is why method hiding is seen as a way to create a new, separate method that coincidentally has the same name, rather than extending or specializing the base class's behavior polymorphically.
