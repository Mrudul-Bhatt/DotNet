Let's delve deeper into method hiding and overriding, their coexistence, behavior with interfaces, compiler internals, runtime testing, and inter-method calls.

### 1\. Can method hiding and method overriding coexist in the same class hierarchy? Give an example.

**Yes, method hiding and method overriding can absolutely coexist within the same class hierarchy.** They serve different purposes and apply to different methods or different forms of the same method.

**Example:**

Consider a hierarchy for processing different types of `Document`s.

```csharp
public class Document
{
    public virtual void Process() // Virtual method, designed for overriding
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Document: Generic processing initiated.");
    }

    public void Save() // Non-virtual method, could be hidden
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Document: Saving to default location.");
    }

    // Overloaded method (not overridden or hidden by itself, but could be part of hiding)
    public void Save(string path)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Document: Saving to {path}.");
    }
}

public class PdfDocument : Document
{
    // Method Overriding: PdfDocument provides its own specific processing logic
    public override void Process()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("PdfDocument: Specific PDF processing and rendering.");
    }

    // Method Hiding: PdfDocument defines its own Save() method, hiding the base one.
    // We use 'new' to explicitly state intent.
    public new void Save()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("PdfDocument: Saving to PDF-specific archive.");
    }

    // This overloads the base Save(string path) method.
    // It is not hiding unless PdfDocument had a Save(string path) method already.
    // It's not overriding because the base Save(string path) is not virtual.
    public void Save(bool compress)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"PdfDocument: Saving with compression: {compress}.");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Document References ---");
        Document doc1 = new Document();
        Document pdfDocAsDoc = new PdfDocument(); // Upcast to base type

        doc1.Process();        // Output: Document: Generic processing initiated.
        doc1.Save();           // Output: Document: Saving to default location.
        doc1.Save("C:\\Docs\\report.docx"); // Output: Document: Saving to C:\Docs\report.docx.

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- PdfDocument as Document ---");
        pdfDocAsDoc.Process(); // Output: PdfDocument: Specific PDF processing and rendering. (Polymorphism!)
        pdfDocAsDoc.Save();    // Output: Document: Saving to default location. (Method Hiding in action!)
        pdfDocAsDoc.Save("C:\\Docs\\presentation.pdf"); // Output: Document: Saving to C:\Docs\presentation.pdf.

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- PdfDocument References ---");
        PdfDocument pdfDoc2 = new PdfDocument();

        pdfDoc2.Process(); // Output: PdfDocument: Specific PDF processing and rendering.
        pdfDoc2.Save();    // Output: PdfDocument: Saving to PDF-specific archive. (Hidden method called!)
        pdfDoc2.Save(true); // Output: PdfDocument: Saving with compression: True. (PdfDocument's new overload)
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Coexistence:**

  * **`Process()` method:** Demonstrates **overriding**. When `pdfDocAsDoc.Process()` is called (via a `Document` reference), the `PdfDocument`'s implementation is executed due to polymorphism.
  * **`Save()` method (parameterless):** Demonstrates **hiding**. When `pdfDocAsDoc.Save()` is called (via a `Document` reference), the `Document`'s implementation is executed. Only when accessed through a `PdfDocument` reference (`pdfDoc2.Save()`) is the hidden `PdfDocument`'s implementation used.
  * **`Save(string path)` and `Save(bool compress)`:** This shows method overloading within the hierarchy. `PdfDocument.Save(bool)` is a completely new method that just happens to share the `Save` name with the base's `Save(string)` method. It's not hiding or overriding that specific overload; it's a distinct method with a different signature.

This example clearly illustrates how both mechanisms can exist side-by-side, each applying to different scenarios based on the `virtual`, `override`, and `new` keywords.

### 2\. What is the behavior of method hiding when accessed via an interface reference?

When a method is hidden (using the `new` keyword or implicitly) and you access it via an **interface reference**, the behavior depends on whether the interface itself defines a method with that same signature:

1.  **If the interface *does not* define a method with that signature:**

      * You simply **cannot call the hidden method** through the interface reference. The interface doesn't know about it. The call will revert to the base class's method (if the interface is a type in the base class hierarchy).

2.  **If the interface *does* define a method with that signature (and the method is explicitly implemented):**

      * This scenario usually involves explicit interface implementation, which is often a form of hiding or a separate implementation from the class's public members. In this case, the explicitly implemented method is chosen.

**More commonly, the relevant question is about *overriding* behavior with interfaces.** An interface method is inherently `virtual` in concept; when a class implements an interface method, it's effectively "implementing" a contract that will be honored polymorphically.

**Example Illustrating Hiding with Interface vs. Overriding:**

```csharp
public interface IPrintable
{
    void Print(); // Interface contract
}

public class BaseDoc : IPrintable
{
    public virtual void Print() // Virtual method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("BaseDoc: Common Printing.");
    }
}

public class DerivedDoc : BaseDoc, IPrintable
{
    // Overriding the virtual method from BaseDoc
    public override void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("DerivedDoc: Specific Printing (Override).");
    }

    // Method Hiding: This is a NEW method specific to DerivedDoc,
    // it DOES NOT implement the IPrintable.Print or override BaseDoc.Print
    public new void Print(string customMessage)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"DerivedDoc: Custom Printing with message: {customMessage}.");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        DerivedDoc dDoc = new DerivedDoc();
        BaseDoc bDoc = dDoc;
        IPrintable iPrint = dDoc;

        dDoc.Print();               // Output: DerivedDoc: Specific Printing (Override). (Derived ref, calls override)
        bDoc.Print();               // Output: DerivedDoc: Specific Printing (Override). (Base ref, calls override due to polymorphism)
        iPrint.Print();             // Output: DerivedDoc: Specific Printing (Override). (Interface ref, calls override due to polymorphism)

        dDoc.Print("Special");      // Output: DerivedDoc: Custom Printing with message: Special. (Hidden method called via derived ref)
        // bDoc.Print("Special");   // Compile-time Error: BaseDoc does not have Print(string)
        // iPrint.Print("Special"); // Compile-time Error: IPrintable does not have Print(string)
    }
}
```

In this example:

  * `DerivedDoc.Print()` (the override) is called polymorphically through `BaseDoc` and `IPrintable` references because it's an `override`.
  * `DerivedDoc.Print(string)` is a *hidden* method. It can **only** be accessed directly through a `DerivedDoc` reference. The `BaseDoc` and `IPrintable` references do not have a method with that signature, so a compile-time error occurs if you try to call it through them.

### 3\. What does the compiler do differently for `override` vs `new` behind the scenes (e.g., v-table entries)?

The core difference lies in how method calls are resolved at runtime:

  * **`override` (Virtual Table / V-Table):**

      * **Behind the Scenes:** When a class contains `virtual` methods, the C\# compiler (and the CLR) sets up a **virtual method table (v-table)** for that class.
          * Each entry in the v-table corresponds to a `virtual` method and points to the *actual implementation* of that method for that specific class.
          * When a derived class `overrides` a `virtual` method, it **replaces the entry** in its v-table (and the v-tables of any subsequent derived classes) for that specific method with a pointer to its *own* overridden implementation.
      * **Runtime Binding:** When you call a `virtual` method through a base class reference (e.g., `BaseClass obj = new DerivedClass(); obj.VirtualMethod();`), the CLR looks at the *actual runtime type* of the object (`DerivedClass`). It then consults `DerivedClass`'s v-table, finds the entry for `VirtualMethod`, and executes the method that its v-table entry points to (which would be `DerivedClass.VirtualMethod()`). This is **dynamic dispatch** or **runtime binding**.

  * **`new` (Method Hiding / Static Binding):**

      * **Behind the Scenes:** When a derived class uses `new` to hide a base method, the compiler **does not modify the v-table** (if the base method was not virtual) or adds a *new, separate entry* for the hidden method in the derived class's own method table. It does *not* affect the base class's v-table or the v-table entries for `virtual` methods.
      * **Compile-Time Binding:** When you call a hidden method, the C\# compiler performs **static binding (compile-time binding)**. It looks *only* at the **declared type of the variable** used to make the call.
          * If the variable is declared as the base type, it will call the base method.
          * If the variable is declared as the derived type, it will call the hidden method in the derived class.
      * **No Polymorphism:** Because the binding happens at compile time based on the variable's type, there is no polymorphic behavior.

**Analogy:**

  * **`override`:** Like a shared phone book (the v-table) for a family business. When a new generation (derived class) takes over a specific role (virtual method), they update the entry in the *same phone book* with their direct number. Anyone looking up that role in the phone book will always get the latest contact.
  * **`new` (Hiding):** Like a family business where an old office (base method) exists, and a new family member (derived class) opens a *completely new office* with the same name, but they only give out the new office's number if you specifically ask for *their* office. If you ask for the general "family business" office, you still get the old one.

### 4\. How would you test whether a method is being hidden or overridden using runtime behavior?

The key to testing this is to use **polymorphism**: specifically, creating an instance of the derived class and then referencing it with both the base class type and the derived class type.

1.  **Test for Overriding (Polymorphism):**

      * Create an instance of the **derived class**.
      * Assign this instance to a variable declared as the **base class type**.
      * Call the method.
      * **If the derived class's implementation is executed**, the method is being overridden.

2.  **Test for Hiding:**

      * Create an instance of the **derived class**.
      * Assign this instance to a variable declared as the **base class type**.
      * Call the method.
      * **If the base class's implementation is executed**, the method is being hidden.
      * Additionally, confirm that if you call the method through a variable declared as the *derived class type*, the derived class's implementation is executed.

**Example Test Code (Conceptual, using a `StringBuilder` to capture output):**

```csharp
using System.Text;

public class TestBase
{
    public virtual void PolymorphicMethod() { Console.WriteLine("Base Polymorphic"); }
    public void HiddenMethod() { Console.WriteLine("Base Hidden"); }
}

public class TestDerived : TestBase
{
    public override void PolymorphicMethod() { Console.WriteLine("Derived Polymorphic"); }
    public new void HiddenMethod() { Console.WriteLine("Derived Hidden"); }
}

public class MethodBehaviorTester
{
    public static void TestBehavior()
    {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        Console.SetOut(new StringWriter(sb)); // Redirect Console.WriteLine output

        TestBase derivedAsBaseForPoly = new TestDerived();
        derivedAsBaseForPoly.PolymorphicMethod();
        Console.WriteLine($"Output for PolymorphicMethod (Base ref): {sb.ToString().Trim()}");
        sb.Clear();

        TestDerived derivedForPoly = new TestDerived();
        derivedForPoly.PolymorphicMethod();
        Console.WriteLine($"Output for PolymorphicMethod (Derived ref): {sb.ToString().Trim()}");
        sb.Clear();

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Hiding Test ---");

        TestBase derivedAsBaseForHide = new TestDerived();
        derivedAsBaseForHide.HiddenMethod();
        Console.WriteLine($"Output for HiddenMethod (Base ref): {sb.ToString().Trim()}");
        sb.Clear();

        TestDerived derivedForHide = new TestDerived();
        derivedForHide.HiddenMethod();
        Console.WriteLine($"Output for HiddenMethod (Derived ref): {sb.ToString().Trim()}");
        sb.Clear();

        Console.SetOut(new StreamWriter(Console.OpenStandardOutput())); // Reset Console.WriteLine
    }
}

// Expected Output (conceptual, assuming internal Console.WriteLine capture):
// --- Overriding Test ---
// Output for PolymorphicMethod (Base ref): Derived Polymorphic  <-- Indicates Overriding
// Output for PolymorphicMethod (Derived ref): Derived Polymorphic

// --- Hiding Test ---
// Output for HiddenMethod (Base ref): Base Hidden           <-- Indicates Hiding
// Output for HiddenMethod (Derived ref): Derived Hidden
```

This simple test confirms that if a base class reference points to a derived object, and calling the method executes the derived version, it's overriding. If it executes the base version, it's hiding.

### 5\. Can an overridden method call a hidden method in the same hierarchy? What would be the behavior?

**Yes, an overridden method can call a hidden method in the same hierarchy.**

The behavior will depend on the **declared type** of the variable or `this` keyword at the point of the call.

**Example:**

```csharp
public class Base
{
    public void LogMessage(string message) // Non-virtual, can be hidden
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Base Log: {message}");
    }

    public virtual void PerformAction()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Base: Performing action.");
        LogMessage("Action performed by Base."); // Calls Base.LogMessage()
    }
}

public class Derived : Base
{
    public new void LogMessage(string message) // Hides Base.LogMessage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Derived Log: {message}");
    }

    public override void PerformAction() // Overrides Base.PerformAction()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Derived: Performing action (overridden).");
        LogMessage("Action performed by Derived."); // !!! Calls Derived.LogMessage()
        base.PerformAction(); // Calls the base's overridden method if available (or the base method if not overridden)
                             // which would then call Base.LogMessage() internally.
    }

    public void PerformActionSpecific()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Derived: Performing specific action.");
        LogMessage("Specific action performed by Derived."); // Calls Derived.LogMessage()
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Via Derived Reference ---");
        Derived d = new Derived();
        d.PerformAction(); // This calls Derived.PerformAction() (the override)

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Via Base Reference ---");
        Base b = new Derived();
        b.PerformAction(); // This calls Derived.PerformAction() (the override, due to polymorphism)
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
--- Via Derived Reference ---
Derived: Performing action (overridden).
Derived Log: Action performed by Derived.
Base: Performing action.
Base Log: Action performed by Base.

--- Via Base Reference ---
Derived: Performing action (overridden).
Derived Log: Action performed by Derived.
Base: Performing action.
Base Log: Action performed by Base.
```

**Behavior Explanation:**

1.  **`d.PerformAction()` (and `b.PerformAction()`):**

      * Both calls ultimately execute `Derived.PerformAction()` due to overriding/polymorphism.

2.  **Inside `Derived.PerformAction()`:**

      * `Console.WriteLine("Derived Log: Action performed by Derived.");`
      * `LogMessage("Action performed by Derived.");` **\<-- This calls `Derived.LogMessage()`\!**
          * Inside the `Derived` class, when `LogMessage` is called without any qualification, the compiler sees the `new` `LogMessage` method declared within `Derived` and binds to that. It's essentially `this.LogMessage("...")`.
      * `base.PerformAction();` **\<-- This explicitly calls the `Base.PerformAction()` implementation.**
          * This then executes the `LogMessage("Action performed by Base.")` line within the context of the `Base.PerformAction()` method. Since that method is *part of the `Base` class*, and `Base`'s `LogMessage` is the one directly accessible to it, it calls `Base.LogMessage()`.

This demonstrates that the binding for hidden methods is still based on the *declared type* of the context (`this` being `Derived` in `Derived.PerformAction()`, and `this` being `Base` in `Base.PerformAction()`). Overriding (polymorphism) only applies to the `virtual`/`override` chain itself; it doesn't change how internal calls to hidden methods are resolved.
