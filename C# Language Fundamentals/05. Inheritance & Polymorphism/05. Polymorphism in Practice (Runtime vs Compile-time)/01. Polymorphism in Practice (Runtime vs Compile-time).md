Let's explore polymorphism in depth, distinguishing between compile-time and runtime aspects, and looking at practical applications with code examples in C\#.

## Polymorphism in Practice (Compile-time vs. Runtime)

Polymorphism, meaning "many forms," is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. This enables writing flexible, extensible, and maintainable code.

There are primarily two types of polymorphism:

1.  **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism):** Achieved through method overloading and operator overloading. The compiler determines which method to call based on the method signature (number, type, and order of parameters) at compile time.
2.  **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism):** Achieved through method overriding and interface implementation. The specific method implementation to be executed is determined at runtime, based on the actual type of the object, not the reference type. This is often referred to as **Dynamic Dispatch**.

### 1\. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

**Concept:**
Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. The compiler uses the number, type, and order of arguments passed during a method call to decide which overloaded method to invoke.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

public class Calculator
{
    // Overloaded method: Add two integers
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Adding two integers.");
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method: Add two doubles
    public double Add(double a, double b)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Adding two doubles.");
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method: Add three integers
    public int Add(int a, int b, int c)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Adding three integers.");
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overloaded method: Concatenate two strings
    public string Add(string s1, string s2)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Concatenating two strings.");
        return s1 + s2;
    }
}

public class CompileTimePolymorphismExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        int sum1 = calc.Add(5, 10);              // Calls Add(int, int)
        Console.WriteLine($"Sum of integers: {sum1}\n");

        double sum2 = calc.Add(3.5, 2.7);        // Calls Add(double, double)
        Console.WriteLine($"Sum of doubles: {sum2}\n");

        int sum3 = calc.Add(1, 2, 3);            // Calls Add(int, int, int)
        Console.WriteLine($"Sum of three integers: {sum3}\n");

        string combined = calc.Add("Hello, ", "World!"); // Calls Add(string, string)
        Console.WriteLine($"Combined string: {combined}\n");

        // The compiler knows which 'Add' method to call based on the arguments at compile time.
    }
}
```

### 2\. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Dispatch)

**Concept:**
Runtime polymorphism relies on method overriding and inheritance. A base class declares a `virtual` method (or an `abstract` method), and derived classes provide their own `override`ing implementations. When a method is called on a base class reference variable that points to a derived class object, the runtime system determines which specific method implementation to execute based on the *actual* type of the object, not the type of the reference variable. This decision at runtime is called **Dynamic Dispatch**.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Base Class
public class Shape
{
    public string Name { get; private set; }

    public Shape(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }

    // Virtual method: Can be overridden by derived classes
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Drawing a generic {Name} shape.");
    }

    // Virtual method: CalculateArea (can be overridden)
    public virtual double CalculateArea()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Calculating area for generic {Name} shape (0 by default).");
        return 0; // Default for a generic shape
    }
}

// Derived Class 1
public class Circle : Shape
{
    public double Radius { get; private set; }

    public Circle(double radius) : base("Circle")
    {
        Radius = radius;
    }

    // Override Draw method for Circle
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Drawing a circle with radius {Radius}.");
        // You could call base.Draw(); here if desired: Console.WriteLine("Base drawing for Circle.");
    }

    // Override CalculateArea for Circle
    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}

// Derived Class 2
public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public double Width { get; private set; }
    public double Height { get; private set; }

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) : base("Rectangle")
    {
        Width = width;
        Height = height;
    }

    // Override Draw method for Rectangle
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Drawing a rectangle with width {Width} and height {Height}.");
    }

    // Override CalculateArea for Rectangle
    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Width * Height;
    }
}

public class RuntimePolymorphismExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Creating objects of derived types
        Circle circle = new Circle(5);
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);
        Shape genericShape = new Shape("Polygon");

        // Using base class references to refer to derived class objects
        List<Shape> shapes = new List<Shape>
        {
            circle,         // Shape reference pointing to a Circle object
            rectangle,      // Shape reference pointing to a Rectangle object
            genericShape    // Shape reference pointing to a Shape object
        };

        Console.WriteLine("--- Demonstrating Dynamic Dispatch ---");
        foreach (Shape shape in shapes)
        {
            // At compile time, 'shape' is of type Shape.
            // At runtime, the CLR determines the actual type of the object (Circle, Rectangle, or Shape)
            // and calls the appropriate overridden (or base) method.
            shape.Draw();
            Console.WriteLine($"Area: {shape.CalculateArea():F2}\n");
        }

        Console.WriteLine("--- Directly calling methods ---");
        circle.Draw();          // Calls Circle's Draw
        rectangle.Draw();       // Calls Rectangle's Draw
        genericShape.Draw();    // Calls Shape's Draw
    }
}
```

In the `foreach` loop, `shape.Draw()` and `shape.CalculateArea()` demonstrate dynamic dispatch. Even though `shape` is declared as `Shape`, the correct `Draw` and `CalculateArea` methods (from `Circle`, `Rectangle`, or `Shape`) are invoked at runtime based on the object's actual type.

### Casting in Polymorphism (`as`, `is`, Pattern Matching)

When working with polymorphic types, you often need to determine an object's actual type or safely cast it to a more specific derived type to access members not available on the base type.

1.  **`is` operator:** Checks if an object is compatible with a given type. It returns `true` or `false`. It does not perform the cast.

    ```csharp
    Shape s1 = new Circle(7);
    Shape s2 = new Rectangle(8, 2);

    if (s1 is Circle) // Checks if s1 is a Circle (or a type derived from Circle)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("s1 is a Circle.");
    }
    if (s2 is Circle) // False
    {
        Console.WriteLine("s2 is a Circle. (This won't print)");
    }
    ```

2.  **`as` operator:** Attempts to cast an object to a specified type. If the cast is successful, it returns the cast object; otherwise, it returns `null`. This is safer than a direct cast because it doesn't throw an `InvalidCastException`.

    ```csharp
    Circle c = s1 as Circle; // c will be the Circle object
    if (c != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Cast successful: Circle with radius {c.Radius}");
    }

    Rectangle r = s1 as Rectangle; // r will be null, as s1 is not a Rectangle
    if (r == null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cast failed: s1 is not a Rectangle.");
    }
    ```

3.  **Direct Cast `()`:** Performs an explicit cast. If the object cannot be cast to the specified type, it throws an `InvalidCastException` at runtime. Use this only when you are certain the cast will succeed.

    ```csharp
    // This will work:
    Circle c2 = (Circle)s1;
    Console.WriteLine($"Direct cast successful: Circle with radius {c2.Radius}");

    // This will throw an InvalidCastException at runtime:
    // Rectangle r2 = (Rectangle)s1; // Throws InvalidCastException
    ```

4.  **Pattern Matching (`is` expression with declaration, `switch` expression/statement - C\# 7+):**
    C\# introduced powerful pattern matching features that combine type checking (`is`) with variable declaration and casting, making code cleaner and safer.

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;

    public class Animal { public string Name { get; set; } }
    public class Dog : Animal { public string Breed { get; set; } }
    public class Cat : Animal { public bool IsLongHaired { get; set; } }

    public class PatternMatchingExample
    {
        public static void ProcessAnimal(Animal animal)
        {
            // 'is' expression with type pattern and declaration
            if (animal is Dog dog) // 'dog' is now a Dog if the cast is successful, otherwise null (not explicitly)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Detected a Dog: {dog.Name}, Breed: {dog.Breed}");
            }
            else if (animal is Cat cat) // 'cat' is now a Cat
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Detected a Cat: {cat.Name}, Long Haired: {cat.IsLongHaired}");
            }
            else if (animal is Animal a) // Fallback for any other Animal
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Detected a generic Animal: {a.Name}");
            }
        }

        public static void GetAnimalSound(Animal animal)
        {
            // Switch expression (C# 8+)
            string sound = animal switch
            {
                Dog d when d.Breed == "Golden Retriever" => "Happy bark!", // Pattern with 'when' clause
                Dog => "Woof!",
                Cat c when c.IsLongHaired => "Soft Meow!", // Pattern with 'when' clause
                Cat => "Meow.",
                _ => "Unknown sound." // Discard pattern for any other type
            };
            Console.WriteLine($"{animal.Name} says: {sound}");
        }

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Animal> animals = new List<Animal>
            {
                new Dog { Name = "Buddy", Breed = "Golden Retriever" },
                new Cat { Name = "Whiskers", IsLongHaired = true },
                new Animal { Name = "Unknown Pet" },
                new Dog { Name = "Rex", Breed = "German Shepherd" }
            };

            foreach (var animal in animals)
            {
                ProcessAnimal(animal);
            }

            Console.WriteLine("\n--- Animal Sounds ---");
            foreach (var animal in animals)
            {
                GetAnimalSound(animal);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Real-World Polymorphism Use Cases

Polymorphism is at the heart of many robust and flexible software designs:

1.  **Frameworks and Libraries:**

      * **Logging Frameworks:** An `ILogger` interface with different implementations (`ConsoleLogger`, `FileLogger`, `DatabaseLogger`, `CloudLogger`). Your application code simply logs to `ILogger`, and the actual output mechanism is determined at runtime based on configuration.
      * **Data Access Layers (DAL):** An `IRepository` interface or `abstract class BaseRepository` with implementations for different databases (SQL Server, MongoDB, Oracle). The application works with `IRepository`, abstracting away the database specifics.
      * **UI Event Handling:** `ICommand` interface or `abstract class CommandBase` for handling user actions (e.g., `SaveCommand`, `OpenCommand`, `DeleteCommand`). UI elements trigger `ICommand.Execute()`, and the specific action is performed polymorphically.

2.  **Plugin Architectures:**

      * A plugin host defines an `IPlugin` interface. Each plugin provides its own implementation of `IPlugin`, which the host can load and execute without knowing the specific details of each plugin.

3.  **Strategy Pattern:**

      * Define an interface for an algorithm (e.g., `ISortStrategy`). Different concrete classes implement different sorting algorithms (`QuickSortStrategy`, `MergeSortStrategy`). A context class uses the `ISortStrategy` to perform sorting without knowing the specific algorithm chosen.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public interface IDiscountStrategy
    {
        decimal ApplyDiscount(decimal price);
    }

    public class NoDiscountStrategy : IDiscountStrategy
    {
        public decimal ApplyDiscount(decimal price) => price;
    }

    public class SeasonalDiscountStrategy : IDiscountStrategy
    {
        public decimal ApplyDiscount(decimal price) => price * 0.9m; // 10% off
    }

    public class VIPDiscountStrategy : IDiscountStrategy
    {
        public decimal ApplyDiscount(decimal price) => price * 0.8m; // 20% off
    }

    public class ShoppingCart
    {
        private IDiscountStrategy _discountStrategy;

        public ShoppingCart(IDiscountStrategy strategy)
        {
            _discountStrategy = strategy;
        }

        public decimal CalculateFinalPrice(decimal originalPrice)
        {
            return _discountStrategy.ApplyDiscount(originalPrice);
        }
    }
    ```

4.  **Factory Pattern:**

      * A factory method returns an object of a base type or interface, but the actual object returned is a specific derived type. The client code then interacts with this object polymorphically.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public interface INotification
    {
        void Send(string recipient, string message);
    }

    public class EmailNotification : INotification
    {
        public void Send(string recipient, string message) => Console.WriteLine($"Sending Email to {recipient}: {message}");
    }

    public class SmsNotification : INotification
    {
        public void Send(string recipient, string message) => Console.WriteLine($"Sending SMS to {recipient}: {message}");
    }

    public class NotificationFactory
    {
        public static INotification CreateNotification(string type)
        {
            return type.ToLower() switch
            {
                "email" => new EmailNotification(),
                "sms" => new SmsNotification(),
                _ => throw new ArgumentException("Unknown notification type")
            };
        }
    }

    // Usage:
    // INotification notifier = NotificationFactory.CreateNotification("email");
    // notifier.Send("user@example.com", "Your order has shipped!");
    ```

In conclusion, polymorphism, especially runtime polymorphism (dynamic dispatch), is a cornerstone of flexible and extensible object-oriented design. It allows you to write code that operates on common abstractions, deferring the decision of which specific implementation to use until runtime, leading to highly adaptable and maintainable systems. Casting and pattern matching provide the tools to safely navigate type hierarchies when more specific behavior is required.
