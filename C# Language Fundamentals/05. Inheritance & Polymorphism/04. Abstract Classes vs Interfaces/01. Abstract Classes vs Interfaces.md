Let's delve into the fundamental differences between Abstract Classes and Interfaces in object-oriented programming, particularly focusing on C\# as it clearly illustrates the distinctions and modern features.

## Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces

Both abstract classes and interfaces define contracts that can be implemented by other classes. However, they serve different purposes and have distinct capabilities, guiding different design decisions.

### Abstract Classes

**Concept:**
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It's designed to be a base class in an inheritance hierarchy. It can contain a mix of concrete (implemented) members and abstract (unimplemented) members. Abstract members must be implemented by concrete derived classes.

**Key Characteristics:**

  * **Partial Implementation:** Can have both abstract methods/properties (no implementation) and concrete methods/properties (with implementation).
  * **Constructors:** Can have constructors. These constructors are called by derived class constructors via `base()`.
  * **Fields:** Can declare fields (instance and static).
  * **Access Modifiers:** Members can have any access modifier (public, protected, internal, private). Abstract members are implicitly `public` or `protected`.
  * **Inheritance:** A class can inherit from **only one** abstract class (single inheritance).
  * **Polymorphism:** Supports polymorphism through the base class reference.
  * **Purpose:** Best suited for "is-a" relationships where derived classes share a common base implementation and conceptual core, but also need to provide specific implementations for certain behaviors. It's often used when you want to provide a default or common set of behaviors and enforce a common type.

**When to Use:**

  * When you want to define a common base class with some default behavior already implemented.
  * When you want to share code among several closely related classes.
  * When you need to declare non-public members (e.g., `protected` fields or methods) that are accessible only to derived classes.
  * When you want to enforce a common type definition for a group of related objects.
  * When you plan for future extensibility by adding new methods to the abstract class without breaking existing derived classes (as you can provide a default implementation).

**C\# Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

// Abstract Class: Represents a generic employee with common properties and behaviors
public abstract class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Salary { get; protected set; } // Protected so derived classes can set it

    // Concrete method (with implementation)
    public void DisplayName()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Employee Name: {Name}");
    }

    // Abstract method (no implementation) - must be implemented by derived classes
    public abstract void CalculateSalary();

    // Concrete method (with implementation) that can be optionally overridden
    public virtual void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Employee is performing general duties.");
    }

    // Constructor - only callable by derived classes
    public Employee(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
        Console.WriteLine($"[Abstract Employee] Initializing {name}");
    }
}

// Derived Concrete Class 1
public class FullTimeEmployee : Employee
{
    private decimal _monthlyBaseSalary;

    public FullTimeEmployee(string name, decimal monthlyBaseSalary) : base(name)
    {
        _monthlyBaseSalary = monthlyBaseSalary;
        Console.WriteLine($"[FullTimeEmployee] Created: {name}");
    }

    // Must implement abstract CalculateSalary()
    public override void CalculateSalary()
    {
        Salary = _monthlyBaseSalary; // Simple calculation
        Console.WriteLine($"{Name}'s Full-Time Salary: {Salary:C}");
    }

    // Can optionally override Work()
    public override void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Full-time employee is working 40 hours a week.");
        // base.Work(); // Can call base implementation if desired
    }
}

// Derived Concrete Class 2
public class ContractEmployee : Employee
{
    private decimal _hourlyRate;
    private int _hoursWorked;

    public ContractEmployee(string name, decimal hourlyRate, int hoursWorked) : base(name)
    {
        _hourlyRate = hourlyRate;
        _hoursWorked = hoursWorked;
        Console.WriteLine($"[ContractEmployee] Created: {name}");
    }

    // Must implement abstract CalculateSalary()
    public override void CalculateSalary()
    {
        Salary = _hourlyRate * _hoursWorked;
        Console.WriteLine($"{Name}'s Contract Salary: {Salary:C}");
    }

    // Can optionally override Work()
    public override void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Contract employee is working {_hoursWorked} hours.");
    }
}

public class AbstractClassExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Employee emp = new Employee("Generic"); // Compile-time error: Cannot create instance of abstract type

        FullTimeEmployee ftEmp = new FullTimeEmployee("Alice", 5000m);
        ftEmp.DisplayName();
        ftEmp.CalculateSalary();
        ftEmp.Work();
        Console.WriteLine("\n");

        ContractEmployee ctEmp = new ContractEmployee("Bob", 30m, 160);
        ctEmp.DisplayName();
        ctEmp.CalculateSalary();
        ctEmp.Work();
        Console.WriteLine("\n");

        // Polymorphism with abstract class
        Console.WriteLine("--- Polymorphic Calls ---");
        Employee emp1 = ftEmp;
        Employee emp2 = ctEmp;

        emp1.CalculateSalary(); // Calls FullTimeEmployee's implementation
        emp2.CalculateSalary(); // Calls ContractEmployee's implementation
        emp1.Work();            // Calls FullTimeEmployee's implementation
        emp2.Work();            // Calls ContractEmployee's implementation
    }
}
```

### Interfaces

**Concept:**
An interface defines a contract for behavior. It specifies a set of members (methods, properties, events, indexers) that a class or struct must implement if it "implements" the interface. Prior to C\# 8, interfaces could only declare members, not implement them. With C\# 8 and later, interfaces can include **default implementations for methods**.

**Key Characteristics:**

  * **Pure Contract (Pre-C\# 8):** Could only declare members; no implementation allowed.
  * **Default Interface Methods (C\# 8+):** Can provide default implementations for methods, which concrete implementers can choose to use or override.
  * **No Constructors:** Interfaces cannot have constructors.
  * **No Fields:** Interfaces cannot declare instance fields (though static fields are allowed in C\# 8+ for constants).
  * **Access Modifiers:** All members are implicitly `public` (unless default implementation is explicitly `private` or `protected` within the interface itself, C\# 8+).
  * **Multiple Implementation:** A class can implement **multiple** interfaces.
  * **Polymorphism:** Supports polymorphism through the interface type.
  * **Purpose:** Best suited for "can-do" or "has-a capability" relationships. It defines a set of behaviors that a class *agrees* to provide, regardless of its inheritance hierarchy.

**When to Use:**

  * When you want to define a contract for behavior that unrelated classes can implement.
  * When you want to achieve multiple inheritance of type (a class can only inherit one base class but can implement many interfaces).
  * When you want to define specific capabilities without forcing a class into a particular inheritance hierarchy.
  * When you want to enable loose coupling and dependency inversion (referring to types by their interface rather than concrete class).
  * When you want to provide optional functionality that classes can opt into (especially with default interface methods).

**C\# Code Example (including Default Interface Methods - C\# 8+):**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Interface 1: Defines logging capability
public interface ILogger
{
    void LogInfo(string message);
    void LogError(string message, Exception ex);

    // C# 8+ Default Interface Method
    void LogWarning(string message)
    {
        // Default implementation for warning. Implementers can use this or override.
        Console.WriteLine($"[WARNING DEFAULT] {message}");
    }
}

// Interface 2: Defines persistence capability
public interface IPersistable
{
    void Save();
    void Load();
}

// Interface 3: Defines audit trail capability (C# 8+ for default method)
public interface IAuditable
{
    // C# 8+ Default Interface Method with an abstract member
    void RecordAuditEntry(string eventName);
    DateTime GetLastAuditTime() // Abstract member in interface (no default impl here)
    {
        // This is a property, but demonstrates how you could have a default impl if it was a method
        throw new NotImplementedException("Implementer must provide last audit time.");
    }

    // Another example of default method that uses other interface members
    void DisplayAuditInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Audit info displayed. Last event recorded at: {GetLastAuditTime()}");
    }
}


// Concrete Class implementing multiple interfaces
public class UserAccount : ILogger, IPersistable, IAuditable
{
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string PasswordHash { get; set; }
    private DateTime _lastAuditTime;

    public UserAccount(string username, string passwordHash)
    {
        Username = username;
        PasswordHash = passwordHash;
        _lastAuditTime = DateTime.MinValue; // Default
    }

    // Implementing ILogger methods
    public void LogInfo(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[INFO - UserAccount:{Username}] {message}");
    }

    public void LogError(string message, Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[ERROR - UserAccount:{Username}] {message}. Exception: {ex.Message}");
    }

    // UserAccount chooses to use the default LogWarning from ILogger.
    // public void LogWarning(string message) // No need to implement, default is used

    // Implementing IPersistable methods
    public void Save()
    {
        LogInfo("Saving UserAccount data.");
        // Logic to save user account to database
        Console.WriteLine($"UserAccount '{Username}' saved.");
    }

    public void Load()
    {
        LogInfo("Loading UserAccount data.");
        // Logic to load user account from database
        Console.WriteLine($"UserAccount '{Username}' loaded.");
    }

    // Implementing IAuditable methods
    public void RecordAuditEntry(string eventName)
    {
        LogInfo($"Recording audit entry for {eventName} on user {Username}.");
        _lastAuditTime = DateTime.UtcNow;
    }

    public DateTime GetLastAuditTime() // Must implement this abstract interface member
    {
        return _lastAuditTime;
    }

    // UserAccount also uses the default DisplayAuditInfo from IAuditable.
    // public void DisplayAuditInfo() // No need to implement, default is used
}

// Another class implementing just one interface and overriding a default method
public class FileProcessor : ILogger
{
    public string FileName { get; set; }

    public FileProcessor(string fileName)
    {
        FileName = fileName;
    }

    public void LogInfo(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[INFO - FileProcessor:{FileName}] {message}");
    }

    public void LogError(string message, Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[ERROR - FileProcessor:{FileName}] {message}. Exception: {ex.Message}");
    }

    // FileProcessor provides its own implementation for LogWarning, overriding the default
    public void LogWarning(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[WARNING CUSTOM - FileProcessor:{FileName}] {message}. Please check file integrity.");
    }
}

public class InterfaceExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        UserAccount user = new UserAccount("john.doe", "hashedpass");
        user.LogInfo("User account created.");
        user.LogWarning("Account setup incomplete."); // Uses default implementation
        user.Save();
        user.Load();
        user.RecordAuditEntry("LoginAttempt");
        user.DisplayAuditInfo(); // Uses default implementation, which calls GetLastAuditTime()

        Console.WriteLine("\n");

        FileProcessor processor = new FileProcessor("document.txt");
        processor.LogInfo("Starting file processing.");
        processor.LogWarning("File size exceeds recommended limit."); // Uses custom implementation
        processor.LogError("Failed to read file.", new InvalidOperationException("File not found."));

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Polymorphic Usage ---");
        List<ILogger> loggers = new List<ILogger>
        {
            user,
            processor
        };

        foreach (var logger in loggers)
        {
            logger.LogInfo("Polymorphic log info.");
            logger.LogWarning("Polymorphic log warning."); // Demonstrates which warning method is called
        }
    }
}
```

### Design Decision: Abstract Class vs. Interface

The choice between an abstract class and an interface often comes down to the nature of the relationship and the desired flexibility.

| Feature             | Abstract Class                                 | Interface (Pre-C\# 8)                                | Interface (C\# 8+)                                       |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Inheritance/Implementation** | Single Inheritance (`class : AbstractClass`) | Multiple Implementation (`class : Interface1, Interface2`) | Multiple Implementation (`class : Interface1, Interface2`) |
| **Implementation** | Can have full, partial, or no implementation.  | No implementation allowed.                          | Can have default method implementations.               |
| **Members** | Fields, properties, methods, events, indexers, constructors. Any access modifier. | Properties, methods, events, indexers. Implicitly `public`. | Properties, methods, events, indexers, static fields/properties, constructors (explicit interface implementation), static/private/protected members. Implicitly `public` unless specified. |
| **Instantiation** | Cannot be instantiated directly.               | Cannot be instantiated directly.                    | Cannot be instantiated directly.                       |
| **Relationship** | "Is-a" relationship (strong coupling).         | "Can-do" / "Has-a-capability" (loose coupling).     | "Can-do" / "Has-a-capability" (loose coupling).        |
| **Code Sharing** | Strong code sharing through implemented methods. | No code sharing directly (only through helper classes). | Code sharing through default method implementations.    |
| **Backward Compatibility** | Adding new abstract methods breaks existing derived classes. | Adding new members breaks existing implementers (pre-C\# 8). | Adding new members with default implementations does not break existing implementers. |
| **Use Case** | Base for closely related objects, common state/behavior, template method pattern. | Defining contracts for disparate types, multiple inheritance of behavior, dependency inversion. | Combines contract definition with shared default behavior, without restricting single inheritance for base classes. |

### When to choose which:

  * **Choose an Abstract Class when:**

      * You have a strong "is-a" relationship between classes (e.g., `Car` is an `Automobile`).
      * You want to provide a common, reusable base implementation for some methods while forcing others to be implemented by derived classes.
      * You need to share instance variables (fields) or protected members among derived classes.
      * You want to define a common type for a family of objects that will likely evolve together.

  * **Choose an Interface (especially pre-C\# 8) when:**

      * You want to define a contract for behavior that can be implemented by completely unrelated classes (e.g., `Car` can be `IDriveable`, `Boat` can be `IDriveable`).
      * You need to support multiple "capabilities" for a single class (e.g., a `Logger` can be `ILogger` and `IDisposable`).
      * You want to achieve loose coupling between components (Dependency Inversion Principle).

  * **Choose an Interface with Default Interface Methods (C\# 8+) when:**

      * You want the benefits of an interface (multiple implementation, loose coupling) but also want to provide common, reusable logic for some members.
      * You need to evolve an existing interface by adding new members without breaking all existing implementers (by providing a default implementation).
      * You want to model "traits" or "mixins" in C\#, allowing classes to inherit behavior from multiple sources (though it's not true multiple inheritance of state).

**Example of Default Interface Methods for backward compatibility:**

Imagine you have `interface IService` with `DoOperationA()` and `DoOperationB()`. You release your library, and many consumers implement `IService`. Later, you realize you need a `DoOperationC()`.

  * **Pre-C\# 8:** Adding `DoOperationC()` to `IService` would break all existing consumers, forcing them to update their code.
  * **C\# 8+:** You can add `void DoOperationC() { /* default implementation */ }`. Existing consumers won't break, as they can rely on the default. New consumers can either use the default or provide their own override. This is a powerful feature for evolving APIs.

In essence, abstract classes are about **inheritance and code sharing in a rigid hierarchy**, while interfaces are about **contracts and capabilities, promoting flexibility and decoupling**. C\# 8's default interface methods bridge some of the gaps, offering a powerful tool for contract evolution and shared optional behavior without sacrificing multiple implementation.
