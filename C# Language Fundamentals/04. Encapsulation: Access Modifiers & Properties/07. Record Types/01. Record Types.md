Let's dive deep into C\# 9.0's Record Types, exploring their core features, the underlying mechanisms, and illustrating them with comprehensive code examples.

-----

### Record Types (C\# 9.0+)

Record types were introduced in C\# 9.0 to provide a more concise and convenient way to define types that are primarily used for storing data. They are essentially a specialized form of `class` (by default) or `struct` (if declared as `record struct`) that automatically generate boilerplate code often needed for data-centric types.

The key idea behind records is **value-based equality**. While classes use reference-based equality (two class instances are equal only if they refer to the exact same object in memory), records, by default, compare their instances based on the values of their properties.

#### Key Features of Records:

1.  **Immutability by Default (with `init` setters):** Records encourage an immutable data model. Positional records and properties declared with `init` setters facilitate this. `init` setters can only be called during object initialization (either in a constructor or object initializer), ensuring that the object's state is fixed after construction.
2.  **Value-Based Equality:** Overrides `Equals(object)`, `GetHashCode()`, and `operator ==`/`operator !=` to compare instances based on the values of their public properties (or fields, if they are public).
3.  **Concise Syntax (Positional Records):** Allows you to define properties and a constructor in a single line.
4.  **`ToString()` Overrides:** Automatically generates a `ToString()` method that prints the type name and the names and values of all public properties, which is very useful for debugging.
5.  **Non-Destructive Mutation (`with` expression):** Provides a convenient syntax (`with` expression) for creating a new record instance that is a copy of an existing instance, but with some properties modified. This supports the immutable pattern.
6.  **Inheritance for Records:** Records can inherit from other records.
7.  **Deconstruction:** Positional records automatically support deconstruction, allowing you to easily extract property values.
8.  **Reference-Type by Default:** Unless explicitly declared as `record struct`, records are reference types.

### 1\. Reference-Type Records

By default, a `record` declaration creates a reference type (like a `class`). This means instances are allocated on the heap, and variables hold references to these instances. The key difference from a regular `class` is the compiler-generated members for value equality, `ToString()`, and `with` expressions.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// --- Basic Reference-Type Record ---
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);
// This single line generates:
// - A public sealed class named Person
// - Public init-only properties: FirstName and LastName
// - A constructor that takes FirstName and LastName
// - Overrides for Equals(), GetHashCode(), operator==, operator!= (for value equality)
// - An override for ToString()
// - Support for deconstruction (e.g., var (first, last) = person;)
// - Support for 'with' expressions

// --- Record with Body (Explicit Properties and Members) ---
public record Product(string Name, decimal Price)
{
    // You can add additional properties/fields/methods
    public string ProductCode { get; init; } // init-only property
    public DateTime LastUpdated { get; private set; } // private setter, not included in value equality by default

    // You can add custom constructors
    public Product(string name, decimal price, string productCode) : this(name, price)
    {
        ProductCode = productCode;
        LastUpdated = DateTime.UtcNow;
    }

    // You can override generated members if needed
    public override string ToString() => $"Product [Code: {ProductCode}, Name: {Name}, Price: {Price:C}]";

    // You can add custom methods
    public Product ApplyDiscount(decimal percentage)
    {
        // 'with' expression for non-destructive mutation
        return this with { Price = Price * (1 - percentage / 100m) };
    }
}

// --- Record Inheritance ---
public record Employee(string FirstName, string LastName, int EmployeeId) : Person(FirstName, LastName);
// Employee inherits FirstName and LastName from Person
// Value equality for Employee includes EmployeeId, FirstName, and LastName

public class ReferenceTypeRecordDemo
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Reference-Type Records ---");

        // 1. Instantiation and ToString()
        Person p1 = new Person("Alice", "Smith");
        Console.WriteLine($"p1: {p1}"); // Uses generated ToString()

        // 2. Value-Based Equality
        Person p2 = new Person("Alice", "Smith");
        Person p3 = new Person("Bob", "Johnson");

        Console.WriteLine($"p1 == p2? {p1 == p2}");     // True (value-based equality)
        Console.WriteLine($"p1.Equals(p2)? {p1.Equals(p2)}"); // True
        Console.WriteLine($"p1 == p3? {p1 == p3}");     // False

        // Reference equality (still false for different instances)
        Console.WriteLine($"ReferenceEquals(p1, p2)? {ReferenceEquals(p1, p2)}"); // False (different objects on heap)

        // 3. Non-Destructive Mutation ('with' expression)
        Product laptop = new Product("Laptop Pro", 1500.00m, "LAPTOP-001");
        Console.WriteLine($"\nOriginal Product: {laptop}");

        // Create a new record instance with modifications
        Product discountedLaptop = laptop with { Price = 1200.00m };
        Console.WriteLine($"Discounted Product: {discountedLaptop}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Original Product (unchanged): {laptop}"); // Original is immutable

        Product cheaperLaptop = laptop.ApplyDiscount(20);
        Console.WriteLine($"Cheaper Product (via method): {cheaperLaptop}");

        // 4. Deconstruction (for positional records)
        var (firstName, lastName) = p1;
        Console.WriteLine($"\nDeconstructed Person: {firstName} {lastName}");

        // 5. Record Inheritance
        Employee emp1 = new Employee("Alice", "Smith", 123);
        Console.WriteLine($"\nemp1: {emp1}");
        Console.WriteLine($"emp1 == p1? {emp1 == p1}"); // False (different types/additional properties for equality)

        Person p4 = emp1; // Upcast to base record
        Console.WriteLine($"p4: {p4}"); // ToString() of Employee is used if overridden, otherwise Person's
        Console.WriteLine($"p4 == p1? {p4 == p1}"); // True if Person's equality considers only FirstName, LastName
                                                   // (This gets tricky with record equality and inheritance,
                                                   // generally equality is based on the *runtime type* and its
                                                   // defined members. p4 has a runtime type of Employee).

        // Value equality between base and derived records can be complex due to runtime type comparison.
        // The generated Equals method for 'Person' will also check the runtime type.
        // So, Person("Alice", "Smith") == Employee("Alice", "Smith", 123) is FALSE because their runtime types differ.
        Console.WriteLine($"Person('Alice','Smith') == Employee('Alice','Smith',123)? {p1.Equals(emp1)}"); // False
    }
}
```

### 2\. Positional Records

Positional records are a concise way to define records where the properties are specified directly in the record header, mimicking the parameters of a primary constructor.

**Syntax:**

```csharp
public record RecordName(Type Property1Name, Type Property2Name, ...);
```

**What it Generates (implicitly):**

  * **Public `init`-only properties:** For each parameter in the header.
  * **Primary constructor:** Matches the header parameters.
  * **`Deconstruct` method:** Allows deconstruction into variables corresponding to the properties.
  * All other standard record features (`ToString()`, value equality, `with` expression).

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

// Positional record for a 2D point
public record Point(int X, int Y);

// Positional record with a body for additional members/validation
public record Circle(Point Center, double Radius)
{
    // Add validation in the primary constructor (or property setters)
    public Circle : this(Center, Radius) // Call primary constructor
    {
        if (Radius <= 0)
        {
            throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(Radius), "Radius must be positive.");
        }
    }

    // You can add more members as needed, just like a class
    public double Area => Math.PI * Radius * Radius;

    public void Move(int deltaX, int deltaY)
    {
        // This is a value type, so 'this' cannot be changed.
        // For positional records, you'd typically use 'with' or return a new instance.
        // This method itself doesn't change 'this'.
        Console.WriteLine($"  [Circle] Moving from {Center} by ({deltaX},{deltaY})");
    }

    // A method that returns a new Circle (immutable pattern)
    public Circle Shift(int deltaX, int deltaY)
    {
        return this with { Center = Center with { X = Center.X + deltaX, Y = Center.Y + deltaY } };
    }
}

public class PositionalRecordDemo
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Positional Records ---");

        // 1. Instantiation
        Point p1 = new Point(10, 20);
        Console.WriteLine($"p1: {p1}"); // Uses generated ToString()

        // 2. Deconstruction
        var (x, y) = p1;
        Console.WriteLine($"Deconstructed Point: X={x}, Y={y}");

        // 3. Value Equality
        Point p2 = new Point(10, 20);
        Point p3 = new Point(30, 40);
        Console.WriteLine($"p1 == p2? {p1 == p2}"); // True
        Console.WriteLine($"p1 == p3? {p1 == p3}"); // False

        // 4. Non-Destructive Mutation with 'with' expression
        Point p4 = p1 with { X = 15 }; // Create a new point with X changed
        Console.WriteLine($"p1: {p1}, p4: {p4}"); // p1 is unchanged

        // 5. Circle Record with body
        Circle c1 = new Circle(new Point(0, 0), 5.0);
        Console.WriteLine($"\nCircle c1: {c1}");
        Console.WriteLine($"c1 Area: {c1.Area:F2}");

        // Attempting invalid radius (throws ArgumentOutOfRangeException)
        // try
        // {
        //     Circle cInvalid = new Circle(new Point(0, 0), -1.0);
        // }
        // catch (ArgumentOutOfRangeException ex)
        // {
        //     Console.WriteLine($"Error creating circle: {ex.Message}");
        // }

        // 6. Shifting a Circle (immutable update)
        Circle c2 = c1.Shift(10, 10);
        Console.WriteLine($"c1 (original): {c1}");
        Console.WriteLine($"c2 (shifted): {c2}");
    }
}
```

-----

### 3\. Concise Syntax

Records primarily offer concise syntax through:

1.  **Positional Record Declaration:** As shown above, this is the most compact form.

    ```csharp
    public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);
    ```

    Compare this to defining a class with immutable properties, constructor, `ToString()`, `Equals()`, `GetHashCode()` manually.

2.  **`init` setters:** They provide a concise way to declare properties that are mutable only during object initialization, encouraging immutability without requiring a full constructor or `readonly` fields.

    ```csharp
    // Equivalent to a property in a positional record
    public string Name { get; init; }

    // Usage:
    MyRecord r = new MyRecord { Name = "New Name" }; // Allowed at initialization
    // r.Name = "Another Name"; // Compile-time error after initialization
    ```

3.  **`with` expression:** While not a declaration syntax, it's a very concise and powerful syntax for non-destructive mutation, which is a cornerstone of working with immutable data.

    ```csharp
    MyRecord newRecord = existingRecord with { Property1 = newValue1, Property2 = newValue2 };
    ```

**Example illustrating conciseness comparison:**

```csharp
using System;

// --- Traditional Class for Data (more verbose for immutability) ---
public sealed class OldSchoolBook
{
    public string Title { get; }
    public string Author { get; }
    public int Pages { get; }

    public OldSchoolBook(string title, string author, int pages)
    {
        Title = title;
        Author = author;
        Pages = pages;
    }

    // Manual implementation required for value equality
    public override bool Equals(object? obj) => obj is OldSchoolBook other && Title == other.Title && Author == other.Author && Pages == other.Pages;
    public override int GetHashCode() => HashCode.Combine(Title, Author, Pages);

    // Manual implementation required for ToString()
    public override string ToString() => $"OldSchoolBook {{ Title = {Title}, Author = {Author}, Pages = {Pages} }}";

    // No built-in 'with' expression, requires manual cloning/constructor call for mutation
    public OldSchoolBook WithNewPages(int newPages) => new OldSchoolBook(Title, Author, newPages);
}


// --- Record Type (Concise Syntax) ---
public record NewSchoolBook(string Title, string Author, int Pages);
// All of the above boilerplate is automatically generated!

public class ConciseSyntaxDemo
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Concise Syntax Demo ---");

        OldSchoolBook book1 = new OldSchoolBook("The Hitchhiker's Guide", "Douglas Adams", 200);
        OldSchoolBook book2 = book1.WithNewPages(210);
        Console.WriteLine($"OldSchoolBook: {book1}, {book2}");

        NewSchoolBook recordBook1 = new NewSchoolBook("The Restaurant at the End", "Douglas Adams", 250);
        NewSchoolBook recordBook2 = recordBook1 with { Pages = 260 };
        Console.WriteLine($"\nNewSchoolBook (Record): {recordBook1}, {recordBook2}");

        Console.WriteLine("\nComparison of effort:");
        Console.WriteLine("  OldSchoolBook: ~25 lines of boilerplate for immutable data class.");
        Console.WriteLine("  NewSchoolBook: 1 line of concise record syntax for the same functionality.");
    }
}
```

Records are a significant addition to C\# for building data models, especially when immutability and value-based equality are desired. They drastically reduce the amount of boilerplate code, making your data types cleaner and less error-prone.
