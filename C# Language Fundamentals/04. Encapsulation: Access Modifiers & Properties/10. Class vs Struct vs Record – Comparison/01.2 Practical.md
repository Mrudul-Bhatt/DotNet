Let's delve into these specific scenarios to understand the nuances of `class`, `struct`, and `record` and their practical implications.

-----

### 1\. You're modeling a `Point(x, y)` type. Would you choose `class`, `struct`, or `record`? Why?

For modeling a `Point(x, y)` type, the best choice among `class`, `struct`, or `record` would be a **`record struct` (if C\# 10+ is available) or a regular `struct`**.

Here's why:

1.  **Nature of `Point`:**

      * A `Point` represents a simple, small data aggregate. Its identity is defined purely by its `X` and `Y` coordinate values. Two points $(1, 2)$ are considered the same if their coordinates are the same, regardless of where they are in memory. This screams **value semantics**.
      * Points are typically immutable. You don't usually "change" a point's coordinates; you create a new point if its position needs to be different.

2.  **Why `struct` (or `record struct`) is preferred over `class`:**

      * **Value Semantics:** `struct`s inherently provide value semantics. When you copy a `PointStruct`, you get a completely independent copy, which is the natural behavior for coordinates. If `Point` were a `class`, assigning one point to another would just copy the reference, leading to potential unintended side effects if one was later "mutated" (which should be avoided for points anyway).
      * **Performance:** `Point` is a very small type (typically two integers or doubles).
          * Using a `struct` avoids heap allocation and garbage collection overhead when `Point`s are created, passed around, or stored in collections. This can lead to significant performance benefits in graphics, physics, or geometry processing where millions of points might be handled.
          * Passing `struct`s by value (which is default for method parameters) means no aliasing issues, which enhances predictability.
      * **Immutability:** While plain `struct`s can be mutable, it's a strong best practice to make them immutable. This aligns perfectly with the conceptual immutability of a `Point` (a location is fixed).

3.  **Why `record struct` is the *best* choice (if C\# 10+):**

      * **All `struct` benefits:** It retains the value semantics, stack allocation (for local variables/inline fields), and performance advantages of a `struct`.
      * **`record` benefits "for free":**
          * **Value Equality:** The compiler automatically generates `Equals`, `GetHashCode`, `==`, and `!=` overrides that perform correct value-based comparison for `X` and `Y`. With a plain `struct`, you'd have to write these manually (though IDEs can help).
          * **Conciseness:** The positional syntax `public record struct Point(int X, int Y);` is incredibly concise.
          * **`with` expression:** Allows for easy, non-destructive "mutation" (e.g., `newPoint = oldPoint with { X = 100 };`) which is perfect for creating slightly modified copies of a point without mutating the original.
          * **`ToString()`:** Provides a helpful string representation automatically.
          * **Deconstruction:** Enables `var (x, y) = point;`.

**Conclusion:**

  * **`record struct Point(int X, int Y);`** is the ideal choice for its combination of value semantics, performance benefits, and the rich features records provide for immutable data types.
  * **`struct Point { public int X { get; init; } public int Y { get; init; } /* Equals, GetHashCode, ToString overrides */ }`** is also a very good choice if `record struct` is not available or if you prefer explicit member definitions, but requires more manual boilerplate for equality methods.
  * **A `class` is generally a poor choice** for `Point` due to its reference semantics, heap allocation overhead for such a small type, and the need for manual `Equals`/`GetHashCode` overrides to achieve desired value-based behavior.

### 2\. Create a struct and show how changes to its copy don't affect the original.

**Concept:** This demonstrates the fundamental nature of value types. When a struct instance is assigned to another variable or passed as a method argument, a *bit-wise copy* of its entire content is created. The new variable holds its own independent copy, so modifying one does not affect the other.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
using System;

// Define a mutable struct for demonstration purposes (though immutability is generally recommended)
public struct MutableCoordinates
{
    public int X; // Public fields are common in simple structs
    public int Y;

    public MutableCoordinates(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }

    public override string ToString() => $"Coordinates {{ X = {X}, Y = {Y} }}";
}

public class StructCopyDemo
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Struct Copy Behavior ---");

        MutableCoordinates originalPoint = new MutableCoordinates(10, 20);
        Console.WriteLine($"Original Point: {originalPoint}");

        // Create a copy of originalPoint
        // This performs a bit-wise copy of the data from originalPoint into copyPoint.
        // copyPoint now holds its own independent set of X and Y values.
        MutableCoordinates copyPoint = originalPoint;
        Console.WriteLine($"Copy Point (initial): {copyPoint}");

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Modifying the Copy Point ---");
        copyPoint.X = 50;
        copyPoint.Y = 60;
        Console.WriteLine($"Copy Point (after modification): {copyPoint}");

        Console.WriteLine($"Original Point (after copy's modification): {originalPoint}"); // Original remains unchanged!

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Demonstration with Method Parameter (Pass by Value) ---");
        // When a struct is passed to a method, a copy is made for the parameter.
        ModifyCoordinates(copyPoint); // 'copyPoint' is passed by value
        Console.WriteLine($"Copy Point (after method call): {copyPoint}"); // Remains unchanged here

        // To contrast, if we needed the original to change, we'd use 'ref' keyword (pass by reference)
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Demonstration with Method Parameter (Pass by Reference using 'ref') ---");
        MutableCoordinates refPoint = new MutableCoordinates(100, 200);
        Console.WriteLine($"Ref Point (initial): {refPoint}");
        ModifyCoordinatesByRef(ref refPoint); // 'refPoint' is passed by reference
        Console.WriteLine($"Ref Point (after method call): {refPoint}"); // Changed!
    }

    // This method receives a *copy* of the struct
    public static void ModifyCoordinates(MutableCoordinates coords)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"  Inside method (before change): {coords}");
        coords.X += 1000;
        coords.Y += 1000;
        Console.WriteLine($"  Inside method (after change): {coords}");
    }

    // This method receives a *reference* to the struct (rarely needed for structs)
    public static void ModifyCoordinatesByRef(ref MutableCoordinates coords)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"  Inside ref method (before change): {coords}");
        coords.X += 1000;
        coords.Y += 1000;
        Console.WriteLine($"  Inside ref method (after change): {coords}");
    }
}
```

**Output Explanation:**

You'll observe that even after `copyPoint.X` and `copyPoint.Y` are changed, `originalPoint`'s values remain `10` and `20`. Similarly, the `ModifyCoordinates` method operates on a copy, so the `copyPoint` variable in `Main` is unaffected. This highlights the independent nature of struct copies, a key characteristic of value types.

### 3\. Given a class `Employee`, how would you convert it to a record while preserving equality and cloning logic?

**Original `Employee` Class:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic; // For HashCode.Combine

public class EmployeeClass
{
    public int Id { get; } // Assuming Id is immutable for equality
    public string FirstName { get; private set; } // Settable for mutation
    public string LastName { get; private set; }
    public decimal Salary { get; private set; }
    public DateTime HireDate { get; }

    public EmployeeClass(int id, string firstName, string lastName, decimal salary, DateTime hireDate)
    {
        Id = id;
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
        Salary = salary;
        HireDate = hireDate;
    }

    // Manual Equality (based on Id, as it's an entity)
    public override bool Equals(object? obj)
    {
        // For entities, equality is usually based on identity (Id)
        if (obj is null || GetType() != obj.GetType()) return false;
        EmployeeClass other = (EmployeeClass)obj;
        return Id == other.Id;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return Id.GetHashCode();
    }

    // Manual Cloning Logic (if needed for non-destructive "mutation")
    public EmployeeClass WithNewSalary(decimal newSalary)
    {
        return new EmployeeClass(this.Id, this.FirstName, this.LastName, newSalary, this.HireDate);
    }

    // Manual ToString()
    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"EmployeeClass {{ Id = {Id}, FirstName = {FirstName}, LastName = {LastName}, Salary = {Salary:C}, HireDate = {HireDate:d} }}";
    }
}
```

**Converting to a `record`:**

When converting a `class` to a `record`, we need to decide on its **identity and desired immutability**.

**Scenario A: Record for Value Object (default record behavior)**

If `Employee` were truly a value object (meaning two employees are equal if ALL their properties are the same, and they are immutable), then a simple positional record or one with `init` setters is perfect. This would be typical for a DTO but less so for a DDD "Entity".

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Record where ALL properties contribute to equality (default record behavior)
// This makes it behave like a Value Object
public record EmployeeRecordValueObject(
    int Id,
    string FirstName,
    string LastName,
    decimal Salary,
    DateTime HireDate
);
// All the boilerplate (Equals, GetHashCode, ToString, with, Deconstruct) is generated.
```

**Scenario B: Record for Entity (preserving ID-based equality and immutability)**

This is the more common scenario if `Employee` is a DDD *Entity* where its identity (the `Id`) defines its equality. We want the benefits of records (immutability, `with` expression, nice `ToString()`) but with custom equality based *only* on `Id`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public record EmployeeRecordEntity
{
    // Id property is often settable if database generates it after creation.
    // Or it could be init, meaning you provide it at creation time.
    public int Id { get; set; } // If database sets it
    // public int Id { get; init; } // If you assign it at creation

    public string FirstName { get; init; }
    public string LastName { get; init; }
    public decimal Salary { get; init; }
    public DateTime HireDate { get; init; }

    // Primary constructor for concise creation
    public EmployeeRecordEntity(int id, string firstName, string lastName, decimal salary, DateTime hireDate)
    {
        Id = id;
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
        Salary = salary;
        HireDate = hireDate;
    }

    // Override Equals and GetHashCode to preserve ID-based equality
    // This is crucial because default record equality compares ALL properties.
    public virtual bool Equals(EmployeeRecordEntity? other)
    {
        if (other is null) return false;
        if (ReferenceEquals(this, other)) return true;
        // The default record equality contract comparison is needed for derived records.
        // Without it, derived records could be equal to base records just by ID.
        if (!EqualityContract.Equals(other.EqualityContract)) return false;

        return Id == other.Id;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return HashCode.Combine(EqualityContract, Id);
    }
}

public class EmployeeConversionDemo
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Converting Class to Record (Employee Entity) ---");

        // --- Original Class Behavior ---
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- EmployeeClass (Manual Equality/Cloning) ---");
        EmployeeClass empClass1 = new EmployeeClass(1, "Bob", "Client", 50000m, new DateTime(2020, 1, 1));
        EmployeeClass empClass2 = new EmployeeClass(1, "Robert", "Client", 55000m, new DateTime(2020, 1, 1)); // Different name/salary, same ID
        Console.WriteLine($"EmpClass1: {empClass1}");
        Console.WriteLine($"EmpClass2: {empClass2}");
        Console.WriteLine($"EmpClass1 == EmpClass2? {empClass1 == empClass2}"); // False (reference equality)
        Console.WriteLine($"EmpClass1.Equals(EmpClass2)? {empClass1.Equals(empClass2)}"); // True (custom ID-based equality)

        EmployeeClass empClassUpdated = empClass1.WithNewSalary(60000m);
        Console.WriteLine($"EmpClass Updated Salary: {empClassUpdated}");


        // --- Converted Record Behavior (Scenario B: Entity with ID-based equality) ---
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- EmployeeRecordEntity (Record with Custom ID-based Equality) ---");
        EmployeeRecordEntity empRecord1 = new EmployeeRecordEntity(1, "Bob", "Client", 50000m, new DateTime(2020, 1, 1));
        EmployeeRecordEntity empRecord2 = new EmployeeRecordEntity(1, "Robert", "Client", 55000m, new DateTime(2020, 1, 1)); // Different name/salary, same ID
        Console.WriteLine($"EmpRecord1: {empRecord1}");
        Console.WriteLine($"EmpRecord2: {empRecord2}");
        Console.WriteLine($"EmpRecord1 == EmpRecord2? {empRecord1 == empRecord2}"); // True (custom ID-based equality due to override)
        Console.WriteLine($"ReferenceEquals(EmpRecord1, EmpRecord2)? {ReferenceEquals(empRecord1, empRecord2)}"); // False (different instances)

        // Using 'with' for non-destructive mutation - automatically generated cloning
        EmployeeRecordEntity empRecordUpdated = empRecord1 with { Salary = 60000m };
        Console.WriteLine($"EmpRecord Updated Salary: {empRecordUpdated}");
        Console.WriteLine($"EmpRecord1 == EmpRecordUpdated? {empRecord1 == empRecordUpdated}"); // True (still same ID)
        Console.WriteLine($"ReferenceEquals(EmpRecord1, EmpRecordUpdated)? {ReferenceEquals(empRecord1, empRecordUpdated)}"); // False (new instance)
    }
}
```

**Preserving Equality and Cloning Logic:**

1.  **Equality:**
      * For a class, you explicitly override `Equals` and `GetHashCode` to define custom equality (e.g., ID-based for entities).
      * For a record (class), the default equality is value-based (all properties). To preserve the ID-based equality of the original `EmployeeClass`, you **must explicitly override `Equals` and `GetHashCode`** in the `EmployeeRecordEntity` to only consider the `Id` property. You also need to include `EqualityContract` in `GetHashCode` and `Equals` for correct inheritance behavior.
2.  **Cloning:**
      * For a class, you manually write methods like `WithNewSalary` to create new instances with changed properties.
      * For a record, the `with` expression automatically provides this non-destructive mutation. You no longer need to write `WithNewSalary` type methods; you simply use `empRecord1 with { Salary = 60000m }`. The record's compiler-generated `Clone()` method handles the copying of other properties.

This conversion retains the core behaviors while gaining the conciseness and safety features of records.

### 4\. How do you clone a class vs. clone a record? Demonstrate both.

**Concept:** "Cloning" means creating a new object that is a copy of an existing one. The mechanisms and best practices differ significantly between classes and records due to their fundamental differences in immutability and default behaviors.

**A. Cloning a `class` (Manual)**

  * **Default Behavior:** Classes are reference types. Simple assignment (`obj2 = obj1;`) only copies the *reference*, not the object itself. So, `obj1` and `obj2` will point to the same object.
  * **Shallow Clone:** Creates a new object, but if the original object contains references to other objects, the *references* to those nested objects are copied. Both the original and clone will point to the same nested objects. This is often done via `MemberwiseClone()`.
  * **Deep Clone:** Creates a new object and recursively creates new copies of all nested objects as well, so no references are shared between the original and the clone. This typically requires manual implementation or serialization/deserialization.
  * **Mutability:** Classes are often mutable, so cloning is about creating a separate, independent version.

**Methods for Class Cloning:**

1.  **Copy Constructor:** A constructor that takes an instance of the same class and initializes the new instance's properties from the source.
2.  **Clone Method (e.g., `ICloneable`):** A method (often implementing `ICloneable`) that returns a new instance.
3.  **`MemberwiseClone()`:** A protected method on `System.Object` that performs a shallow copy.

**Code Example (Class Cloning):**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Example of a nested mutable class
public class AddressClass
{
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }

    public AddressClass(string street, string city) { Street = street; City = city; }
    public override string ToString() => $"AddressClass {{ Street = {Street}, City = {City} }}";
}

public class EmployeeClassToClone : ICloneable // Implementing ICloneable is discouraged but shown for demo
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public AddressClass HomeAddress { get; set; } // Reference to a mutable class

    // Constructor
    public EmployeeClassToClone(int id, string name, AddressClass homeAddress)
    {
        Id = id;
        Name = name;
        HomeAddress = homeAddress;
    }

    // --- 1. Copy Constructor (Common for creating new, independent instances) ---
    public EmployeeClassToClone(EmployeeClassToClone original)
    {
        Id = original.Id;
        Name = original.Name;
        HomeAddress = new AddressClass(original.HomeAddress.Street, original.HomeAddress.City); // Deep copy of nested object
    }

    // --- 2. Shallow Clone using MemberwiseClone() ---
    // Note: ICloneable is often discouraged because its behavior (shallow/deep) is ambiguous.
    public object Clone()
    {
        // MemberwiseClone performs a shallow copy.
        // For value types (Id, Name) it copies values.
        // For reference types (HomeAddress), it copies the *reference*.
        return (EmployeeClassToClone)MemberwiseClone();
    }

    // --- 3. Custom Deep Clone Method ---
    public EmployeeClassToClone DeepClone()
    {
        return new EmployeeClassToClone(
            this.Id,
            this.Name,
            new AddressClass(this.HomeAddress.Street, this.HomeAddress.City) // Explicitly create new Address
        );
    }

    public override string ToString() => $"EmployeeClassToClone {{ Id = {Id}, Name = {Name}, HomeAddress = {HomeAddress} }}";
}

public class ClassCloningDemo
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Class Cloning (Manual) ---");

        AddressClass originalAddress = new AddressClass("123 Main St", "Anytown");
        EmployeeClassToClone emp = new EmployeeClassToClone(1, "Alice", originalAddress);
        Console.WriteLine($"Original Employee: {emp}");

        // --- Shallow Copy (Reference Copy) via simple assignment ---
        EmployeeClassToClone empRefCopy = emp;
        empRefCopy.Name = "Alicia"; // This changes emp.Name too!
        empRefCopy.HomeAddress.Street = "456 Oak Ave"; // This changes originalAddress too!
        Console.WriteLine($"\nAfter simple assignment (ref copy) and mutation:");
        Console.WriteLine($"  Ref Copy: {empRefCopy}");
        Console.WriteLine($"  Original: {emp}");
        Console.WriteLine($"  Original Address: {originalAddress}"); // Original Address object also changed!


        // Reset original for next demos
        originalAddress = new AddressClass("123 Main St", "Anytown");
        emp = new EmployeeClassToClone(1, "Alice", originalAddress);


        // --- Shallow Clone via MemberwiseClone() ---
        EmployeeClassToClone empShallowClone = (EmployeeClassToClone)emp.Clone();
        empShallowClone.Name = "Bob"; // Only changes empShallowClone's name
        empShallowClone.HomeAddress.Street = "789 Pine Rd"; // This *still* changes the original's Address object!

        Console.WriteLine($"\nAfter shallow clone (MemberwiseClone) and mutation:");
        Console.WriteLine($"  Shallow Clone: {empShallowClone}");
        Console.WriteLine($"  Original: {emp}"); // Original Name is unchanged, but Address changed!
        Console.WriteLine($"  Original Address: {originalAddress}"); // Original Address object changed!


        // Reset original for next demos
        originalAddress = new AddressClass("123 Main St", "Anytown");
        emp = new EmployeeClassToClone(1, "Alice", originalAddress);

        // --- Deep Clone via Copy Constructor / Custom Method ---
        EmployeeClassToClone empDeepCopy = new EmployeeClassToClone(emp); // Using copy constructor
        // OR: EmployeeClassToClone empDeepCopy = emp.DeepClone();
        empDeepCopy.Name = "Charlie"; // Changes only empDeepCopy
        empDeepCopy.HomeAddress.Street = "101 Elm Blvd"; // Changes only empDeepCopy's Address

        Console.WriteLine($"\nAfter deep copy (Copy Constructor) and mutation:");
        Console.WriteLine($"  Deep Copy: {empDeepCopy}");
        Console.WriteLine($"  Original: {emp}"); // Original is completely untouched
        Console.WriteLine($"  Original Address: {originalAddress}"); // Original Address object also untouched!
    }
}
```

**B. Cloning a `record` (Non-Destructive Mutation via `with` expression)**

  * **Default Behavior:** Records are designed for immutability. You don't "clone" them in the traditional sense of making a mutable copy; you create a *new instance* that is a copy of the old one, possibly with modifications. This is called **non-destructive mutation**.
  * **`with` Expression:** The compiler automatically generates the necessary `Clone()` method (an internal one called `$Clone()`) to facilitate the `with` expression.
  * **Shallow Copy:** The `with` expression performs a **shallow copy** by default. If a record contains a reference to another *mutable class* (not a nested record), that reference is copied. Changing the referenced object through the new record will also affect the original.
  * **Deep Copy for Nested Records:** If a record contains *another record* as a property, the `with` expression can be **nested** to achieve deep copies for the record hierarchy.

**Code Example (Record Cloning with `with`):**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Immutable; // For ImmutableList (highly recommended)

// Example of a nested immutable record
public record AddressRecord(string Street, string City);

public record EmployeeRecordToClone(
    int Id,
    string Name,
    AddressRecord HomeAddress, // Nested record (immutable)
    ImmutableList<string> Skills // Immutable list (highly recommended for collections)
);

public class RecordCloningDemo
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Record Cloning ('with' Expression) ---");

        EmployeeRecordToClone empRecord = new EmployeeRecordToClone(
            1,
            "Alice",
            new AddressRecord("123 Main St", "Anytown"),
            ImmutableList.Create("C#", "Azure")
        );
        Console.WriteLine($"Original Employee Record: {empRecord}");

        // --- Cloning with no changes (creates a new instance, but value-equal) ---
        EmployeeRecordToClone empCopy = empRecord with { };
        Console.WriteLine($"\nCopied Record (no changes): {empCopy}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Original == Copied? {empRecord == empCopy}"); // True (value-equal)
        Console.WriteLine($"ReferenceEquals(Original, Copied)? {ReferenceEquals(empRecord, empCopy)}"); // False (different instances)

        // --- Cloning with specific property changes (non-destructive mutation) ---
        EmployeeRecordToClone empUpdatedName = empRecord with { Name = "Alicia" };
        Console.WriteLine($"\nUpdated Name Record: {empUpdatedName}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Original == UpdatedName? {empRecord == empUpdatedName}"); // False (value-different)
        Console.WriteLine($"ReferenceEquals(Original, UpdatedName)? {ReferenceEquals(empRecord, empUpdatedName)}"); // False

        // --- Deeply nested cloning (modifying nested record property) ---
        EmployeeRecordToClone empUpdatedAddress = empRecord with
        {
            HomeAddress = empRecord.HomeAddress with { Street = "456 Oak Ave" } // Nested 'with' for nested record
        };
        Console.WriteLine($"\nUpdated Address Record: {empUpdatedAddress}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Original Address == Updated Address? {empRecord.HomeAddress == empUpdatedAddress.HomeAddress}"); // False

        // --- Adding to an ImmutableList (non-destructive) ---
        EmployeeRecordToClone empWithNewSkill = empRecord with
        {
            Skills = empRecord.Skills.Add("DDD")
        };
        Console.WriteLine($"\nRecord with new skill: {empWithNewSkill}");
    }
}
```

| **Nested Refs** | `MemberwiseClone` is shallow. Deep cloning requires manual code. | `with` is shallow by default. Nested `with` for nested records. Requires `ImmutableArray/List` for collection deep copy. |
| **Boilerplate** | High (manual implementation for each cloning variant)    | Low (compiler generates everything for `with`)         |

### 5\. In what cases might a struct introduce unexpected bugs in LINQ or `foreach` loops?

Structs, due to their value-type semantics and potential for mutability (if not designed immutably), can introduce subtle and often unexpected bugs in scenarios involving LINQ, `foreach` loops, and other collection-based operations.

The core issue stems from **implicit copying** and **mutation of copies**.

**Cases where `struct`s can cause bugs:**

1.  **Modifying Structs Inside a `foreach` Loop:**

      * **Problem:** The iteration variable in a `foreach` loop for value types (like `struct`s) is a *copy* of the element from the collection. If you try to modify properties of this copy, you are modifying the copy, not the original element within the collection. The original collection remains unchanged, leading to logic errors.
      * **Explanation:** `foreach` inherently creates read-only local copies for value types to prevent unexpected modification of the underlying collection during iteration, which could lead to issues like `InvalidOperationException`.
      * **Bug:** You intend to update items in a list, but only the copies get updated.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public struct MutableProduct
    {
        public int Id;
        public string Name;
        public decimal Price;

        public MutableProduct(int id, string name, decimal price) => (Id, Name, Price) = (id, name, price);
        public override string ToString() => $"Product {{ Id = {Id}, Name = {Name}, Price = {Price:C} }}";
    }

    public static void ForeachStructBug()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Bug: Modifying mutable struct in foreach ---");
        List<MutableProduct> products = new List<MutableProduct>
        {
            new MutableProduct(1, "Laptop", 1200m),
            new MutableProduct(2, "Mouse", 25m)
        };

        Console.WriteLine("Before loop:");
        products.ForEach(p => Console.WriteLine(p)); // Using ForEach for quick print

        foreach (var product in products) // 'product' here is a COPY
        {
            // This modifies the *copy*, not the original item in the list
            product.Price += 10m; // This line is permitted by C# but doesn't affect the original list
            Console.WriteLine($"  Inside loop (copy modified): {product}");
        }

        Console.WriteLine("After loop (original list unchanged!):");
        products.ForEach(p => Console.WriteLine(p)); // Prices are still original
    }
    ```

    **Fix:** To modify items in a `List<struct>`, you need to use a `for` loop with indexer (`products[i].Price += 10m;`) or replace the element entirely. However, the best fix is to make `MutableProduct` an immutable `record struct` and use the `with` expression to create a new, modified instance, then replace the original in the list.

2.  **Capturing Mutable Structs in Closures (LINQ `Select`, `Where`, etc.):**

      * **Problem:** When a mutable struct is captured by a lambda expression (closure) in LINQ operations, a *copy* of the struct is captured. Any modifications to the struct *outside* the lambda after it's captured will not affect the captured copy within the lambda.
      * **Bug:** The LINQ query processes an outdated or unexpected state of the struct.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public static void LinqStructClosureBug()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Bug: Mutable struct in LINQ closure ---");
        MutableProduct currentProduct = new MutableProduct(10, "Monitor", 300m);

        // This lambda captures a *copy* of currentProduct as it is right now.
        var expensiveProductsFilter = (MutableProduct p) => p.Price > currentProduct.Price;

        // NOW, we change the original currentProduct
        currentProduct.Price = 500m; // Original product's price is now 500

        List<MutableProduct> allProducts = new List<MutableProduct>
        {
            new MutableProduct(11, "Keyboard", 150m),
            new MutableProduct(12, "High-End Monitor", 400m),
            new MutableProduct(13, "Mouse Pad", 10m),
            new MutableProduct(14, "Premium Monitor", 600m)
        };

        // This will still use 300m for currentProduct.Price in the filter!
        var filtered = allProducts.Where(expensiveProductsFilter).ToList();

        Console.WriteLine($"Original product price (after change): {currentProduct.Price:C}"); // 500
        Console.WriteLine($"Products considered expensive (filtered using original price 300m):");
        filtered.ForEach(p => Console.WriteLine($"  {p}"));
        // Only "High-End Monitor" (400) and "Premium Monitor" (600) are > 300
        // If it used 500, only "Premium Monitor" would be included.
    }
    ```

    **Fix:** Always use immutable structs. If you need to "update" the `currentProduct`, create a new instance and ensure the lambda captures the *new* instance or the relevant property.

3.  **Returning Structs by Reference (e.g., from properties, indexers) and then Mutating:**

      * **Problem:** If a property or indexer returns a mutable struct *by value* (the default), you get a copy. If it returns *by reference* (`ref`), you get a reference to the actual storage location, allowing direct mutation. Developers might forget which is which.
      * **Bug:** Confusion arises about whether changes are affecting the original or a copy.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    public class ProductCatalog
    {
        private MutableProduct _storedProduct;

        public ProductCatalog(MutableProduct initialProduct)
        {
            _storedProduct = initialProduct;
        }

        // Returns a COPY of the struct (default)
        public MutableProduct GetProductCopy() => _storedProduct;

        // Returns a REFERENCE to the struct (rare, risky)
        public ref MutableProduct GetProductRef() => ref _storedProduct;
    }

    public static void StructRefReturnBug()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Struct returning by copy vs. ref ---");
        ProductCatalog catalog = new ProductCatalog(new MutableProduct(1, "Chair", 100m));

        // GetProductCopy returns a copy. Mutating it doesn't affect the catalog's product.
        MutableProduct copy = catalog.GetProductCopy();
        copy.Price = 120m;
        Console.WriteLine($"Product in catalog (after copy mutation): {catalog.GetProductCopy()}"); // Still 100m

        // GetProductRef returns a reference. Mutating it *does* affect the catalog's product.
        ref MutableProduct reference = ref catalog.GetProductRef();
        reference.Price = 150m;
        Console.WriteLine($"Product in catalog (after ref mutation): {catalog.GetProductCopy()}"); // Now 150m
    }
    ```

    **Fix:** Always make structs immutable. If a value needs to be changed, create a new struct with the `with` expression and replace the old one in the collection/field.

**General Solution to Avoid `struct` Bugs:**

The overarching solution to almost all unexpected `struct` bugs is to **make your structs immutable**.

  * Use `readonly` fields or `init` properties.
  * If you need a "modified" version of a struct, create a new struct instance (e.g., using a copy constructor or, ideally, a `with` expression if it's a `record struct`).
  * When storing structs in collections like `List<T>`, if you need to "update" an item, you must replace the item at the specific index with a new, modified struct instance (`list[index] = list[index] with { ... };`).
  * If a method needs to modify a struct parameter and affect the caller, use the `ref` keyword, but this should be done cautiously.

By adhering to immutability, structs behave predictably, and the common pitfalls in LINQ and `foreach` loops are largely eliminated.
