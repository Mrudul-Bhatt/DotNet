Let's break down the key differences between `class`, `struct`, and `record` in C\#, including their type categories, equality behaviors, immutability, passing mechanisms, and inheritance.

### 1\. What are the key differences between `class`, `struct`, and `record` in C\#?

Here's a summary of the fundamental differences:

| Feature                   | `class` (Traditional)                | `struct` (Value Type)                  | `record` (Reference Type by default) |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Type Category** | Reference Type                       | Value Type                             | Reference Type (by default)          |
| **Primary Use Case** | Behavior-centric objects, complex objects, polymorphic behavior. | Small data structures, performance-sensitive scenarios where value semantics are desired. | Data-centric objects, immutable data models, value-based equality. |
| **Memory Allocation** | Heap                                 | Stack (locals/params), Inline (fields) | Heap                                 |
| **Default Equality** | Reference equality (`==`, `Equals()`) | Value equality (`==`, `Equals()`)      | Value equality (`==`, `Equals()`)      |
| **Default `ToString()`** | Full type name                     | Full type name (often needs override) | Formatted string of members        |
| **Default Immutability** | Mutable                              | Mutable                                | Immutable (with `init` setters)      |
| **Copying** | Copies reference                     | Copies all data (bit-wise)             | Copies reference (shallow copy), `with` expression creates new copy. |
| **Inheritance** | Yes (single base class)              | No (implicitly inherits from `ValueType`) | Yes (single base record)             |
| **Deconstruction** | No (requires manual `Deconstruct` method) | No (requires manual `Deconstruct` method) | Yes (automatic for positional records) |
| **`with` Expressions** | No (requires manual copy constructor) | No (requires manual copy constructor)  | Yes (automatic)                      |
| **Nullable** | Can be `null`                      | Cannot be `null` (unless `Nullable<T>`) | Can be `null`                      |

### 2\. Which one is a reference type, and which are value types? How does that impact their behavior?

  * **`class`:** Is a **reference type**.
  * **`struct`:** Is a **value type**.
  * **`record`:** By default, is a **reference type**. (However, `record struct` is a value type).

**Impact on Behavior:**

The fundamental difference between reference and value types dictates how they are stored in memory, how they are copied, and how equality is handled.

| Behavior Aspect     | Reference Type (`class`, `record` by default)                                  | Value Type (`struct`, `record struct`)                               |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory Storage** | Instances are allocated on the **managed heap**. Variables hold a **reference** (memory address) to the object on the heap. | Instances are typically allocated on the **stack** (for local variables and method parameters) or stored **inline** within a heap-allocated object (if it's a field of a class). Variables directly hold the **data itself**. |
| **Assignment (`=`)**| Copies the **reference**. Both variables will point to the *same object* in memory. Changes via one variable affect the other. | Copies the **entire data** (a bit-wise copy). Each variable holds its *own independent copy*. Changes to one do not affect the other. |
| **Passing to Methods**| A **copy of the reference** is passed. The method can modify the object that the reference points to, affecting the original. | A **copy of the data** is passed. The method receives an independent copy; modifying it does not affect the original variable in the caller's scope. |
| **Garbage Collection**| Instances on the heap are subject to garbage collection. If no references point to an object, it becomes eligible for GC. | Not directly managed by GC (if on stack). If a field of a class, it's reclaimed with the class instance. |
| **`null` Value** | Can be `null` (the reference points to nothing).                                | Cannot be `null` (always holds a value, unless wrapped in `Nullable<T>`). |

### 3\. What is the default equality comparison behavior of classes, structs, and records?

  * **`class` (Traditional Classes):**

      * **Default Behavior:** **Reference equality**.
      * `==` operator: Checks if two references point to the exact same object in memory.
      * `Equals()` method (inherited from `System.Object`): Also checks if two references point to the exact same object in memory.
      * **Result:** `new MyClass() == new MyClass()` is `false`.

  * **`struct`:**

      * **Default Behavior:** **Value equality**.
      * `==` operator: For primitive types (like `int`, `double`), it's value equality. For custom `struct` types, the default `==` operator (if not overloaded) will perform a member-wise comparison of all fields.
      * `Equals()` method (inherited from `System.ValueType`): Performs a **member-wise comparison** of all fields (both public and private). This uses reflection internally, which can be slow for complex structs.
      * **Result:** `new MyStruct(1) == new MyStruct(1)` is often `true` by default, but the `Equals` implementation can be inefficient. **It's highly recommended to explicitly override `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` for custom structs for performance and correctness.**

  * **`record` (both `record class` and `record struct`):**

      * **Default Behavior:** **Value equality**.
      * `==` operator: Overridden by the compiler to perform value equality.
      * `Equals()` method: Overridden by the compiler to perform value equality (implements `IEquatable<T>`).
      * **Logic:** Two records are equal if they are of the same runtime type and all their **public instance fields and public instance properties** have equal values (shallow comparison for reference types).
      * **Result:** `new MyRecord(1) == new MyRecord(1)` is `true`.

### 4\. What is a positional record and how is it different from a normal class or struct?

A **positional record** is a specific, concise syntax for defining a `record` type (either `record class` or `record struct`) using a **primary constructor**.

**Syntax:**

```csharp
public record MyPositionalRecord(Type1 Param1, Type2 Param2, ...);
```

**How it's different from a normal class or struct (and even a non-positional record):**

The primary constructor in a positional record tells the compiler to *automatically generate* several members that you'd typically have to write manually in a class or struct:

1.  **Public `init`-only properties:** For each parameter in the primary constructor, a public `init`-only property is generated. This ensures immutability by default.
      * A normal class/struct requires you to manually define properties (e.g., `public string Name { get; set; }` or `public readonly string Name;`) and constructors.
2.  **Constructor:** A public constructor matching the primary constructor's signature is generated.
3.  **`Deconstruct` method:** A `Deconstruct` method is automatically generated, allowing you to easily unpack the record's values into separate variables.
      * A normal class/struct requires you to manually implement a `Deconstruct` method if you want this functionality.
4.  **Value-based `Equals()`, `GetHashCode()`, `ToString()`:** These overrides are generated based on the properties defined by the primary constructor.
      * Normal classes require manual overrides.
      * Normal structs get a default `Equals()` from `ValueType` (which is often inefficient) and require manual overrides for efficient value equality.

In essence, a positional record is a highly condensed way to define a data-centric type with immutability, value equality, and deconstruction built-in, drastically reducing boilerplate compared to a traditional class or struct.

### 5\. How does immutability relate to records? Are classes and structs immutable by default?

  * **Records:**

      * Records are designed with **immutability as a primary goal**.
      * **By default, when using a positional record syntax (primary constructor), the generated properties are `init`-only.** This means they can only be assigned a value during object initialization (either in the constructor or an object initializer) and become read-only afterward. This makes the record instance immutable after construction.
      * Records also provide the `with` expression for "non-destructive mutation," which creates a *new* immutable copy with modifications, rather than altering the original.
      * While you *can* define `set` properties in a record, it goes against their design principles and should be used with caution, as it can lead to unexpected behavior with value equality (shallow comparison) and `with` expressions.

  * **Classes:**

      * **Classes are NOT immutable by default.**
      * Properties in classes are typically defined with `get; set;` accessors, making them fully mutable.
      * To make a class immutable, you must manually:
          * Make all properties `get`-only or `init`-only.
          * Provide a constructor to set all properties.
          * Often, provide methods for "non-destructive mutation" (e.g., `WithXyz()` or a copy constructor).

  * **Structs:**

      * **Structs are NOT immutable by default.**
      * While often used for immutable data, structs' fields are mutable by default unless explicitly marked `readonly`.
      * If a `struct` has mutable fields, its copy-by-value semantics can lead to confusing behavior (e.g., modifying a copy, not the original).
      * The `readonly struct` modifier (C\# 7.2+) is used to explicitly declare that a struct and all its members are immutable, enabling better compiler optimizations and preventing accidental mutations. It's generally recommended for structs.

**Summary of Immutability:**

  * **Record:** Immutable by default (via `init` setters in positional records).
  * **Class:** Mutable by default. Must be explicitly designed for immutability.
  * **Struct:** Mutable by default. Can be made immutable with `readonly` modifier.

### 6\. When is a struct copied by value and when is it passed by reference? How does this compare to classes and records?

This goes back to the fundamental distinction between value types and reference types:

**`struct` (Value Type):**

  * **Copied by Value (Default Behavior):**

      * When you assign one struct variable to another: `MyStruct s1 = new(); MyStruct s2 = s1;` - a complete bit-wise copy of `s1`'s data is made into `s2`. `s1` and `s2` are independent.
      * When a struct is passed as an **argument to a method** (without `ref`, `out`, or `in`): The method receives a copy of the struct. Any modifications inside the method affect only that copy, not the original.
      * When a struct is returned from a method: A copy of the struct is returned.
      * When a struct is stored in a `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, or any generic collection: A copy of the struct's data is stored directly in the collection's memory.

  * **Passed by Reference (Explicit Keywords):**

      * When passed with `ref`: `void M(ref MyStruct s)` - The method receives a reference to the original struct's memory location. Changes inside the method *do* affect the original.
      * When passed with `out`: `void M(out MyStruct s)` - Similar to `ref`, but the variable must be assigned within the method.
      * When passed with `in` (C\# 7.2+): `void M(in MyStruct s)` - The method receives a read-only reference to the original struct. This avoids copying for large structs but prevents modification within the method. This is often preferred for large `readonly struct` types to optimize performance.

**`class` (Reference Type):**

  * **Always Passed/Copied by Reference (by value for the reference itself):**
      * When you assign one class variable to another: `MyClass c1 = new(); MyClass c2 = c1;` - A copy of the *reference* (memory address) is made. Both `c1` and `c2` now point to the *same object* on the heap.
      * When a class instance is passed as an **argument to a method**: A copy of the *reference* is passed. The method can modify the original object through this copied reference.
      * When a class instance is returned from a method: A copy of the *reference* to the object on the heap is returned.
      * When a class instance is stored in any collection: A copy of the *reference* to the object is stored.

**`record` (Reference Type by default):**

  * **Behaves like `class` in terms of passing/copying references:**
      * When you assign one record variable to another: `MyRecord r1 = new(); MyRecord r2 = r1;` - Copies the **reference**. Both `r1` and `r2` point to the *same object* on the heap.
      * When a record is passed as an argument to a method: A copy of the *reference* is passed. The method can operate on the same object.
  * **The `with` expression is the exception:** While assignment/passing is by reference, the `with` expression *explicitly* creates a **new copy** of the object (shallow copy of its members) and then applies modifications to that new copy, thus simulating value-like mutation behavior.

**`record struct` (Value Type):**

  * **Behaves like `struct`:**
      * Copies by value by default.
      * Can be passed by reference using `ref`, `out`, or `in`.

### 7\. Which of the three types supports inheritance, and how?

  * **`class`:**

      * **Supports Inheritance:** Yes.
      * **How:** Classes fully support single inheritance (a class can inherit from one base class) and can implement multiple interfaces. This is the traditional object-oriented inheritance model.
      * Syntax: `public class DerivedClass : BaseClass, IInterface1, IInterface2`

  * **`struct`:**

      * **Does NOT Support Explicit Inheritance:** No.
      * **How:** Structs implicitly inherit from `System.ValueType`, which itself inherits from `System.Object`. You cannot specify a base class for a struct (other than `System.ValueType` implicitly), nor can a struct be a base type for a class or another struct.
      * Structs *can* implement interfaces. This allows them to participate in polymorphism through interface contracts.

  * **`record` (Reference Type by Default):**

      * **Supports Inheritance:** Yes.
      * **How:** Records support single inheritance from other records. They extend the value equality and `with` expression semantics to the entire inheritance hierarchy. Derived records must include the base record's primary constructor parameters in their own. Records can also implement interfaces.
      * Syntax: `public record DerivedRecord : BaseRecord, IInterface`
      * **Important:** `record struct` types, like regular `structs`, do *not* support inheritance beyond implicitly inheriting from `System.ValueType`.

**Summary of Inheritance:**

  * **`class`:** Full single inheritance.
  * **`struct`:** No inheritance (only implicitly from `ValueType`), but can implement interfaces.
  * **`record` (reference):** Single inheritance from other records, can implement interfaces.
  * **`record struct` (value):** No inheritance (like regular structs), but can implement interfaces.
