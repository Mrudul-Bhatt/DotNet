Let's break down each of these C\# scenarios.

-----

### **1. Whatâ€™s the output or behavior of the following?**

```csharp
string s = null;
Console.WriteLine(s ?? "default");
```

**Output:**

```
default
```

**Behavior Explanation:**

This code snippet demonstrates the use of the **null-coalescing operator (`??`)**.

1.  `string s = null;`: A string variable `s` is declared and explicitly initialized to `null`.
2.  `Console.WriteLine(s ?? "default");`:
      * The `??` operator checks its left-hand operand (`s`).
      * Since `s` is `null`, the `??` operator evaluates its right-hand operand, which is the string literal `"default"`.
      * The value `"default"` is then passed to `Console.WriteLine()`, resulting in `"default"` being printed to the console.

**In essence:** The `??` operator provides a convenient way to supply a default value when a nullable type or reference type variable is `null`. It's a shorthand for a more verbose `if (s == null) { /* use default */ } else { /* use s */ }` structure.

-----

### **2. How would you use the null-conditional operator to safely access nested properties?**

```csharp
var name = employee?.Department?.Manager?.Name;
```

**Explanation:**

This line of code effectively and safely accesses potentially nested properties using the **null-conditional operator (`?.`)**.

  * **Traditional (Unsafe) Approach:** Without `?.`, accessing deeply nested properties can lead to a `NullReferenceException` if any object in the chain is `null`.

    ```csharp
    // Potentially throws NullReferenceException if employee, Department, or Manager is null
    // var name = employee.Department.Manager.Name;
    ```

  * **Traditional (Safe but Verbose) Approach:** This required multiple explicit null checks:

    ```csharp
    string name = null;
    if (employee != null)
    {
        if (employee.Department != null)
        {
            if (employee.Department.Manager != null)
            {
                name = employee.Department.Manager.Name;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

  * **Using Null-Conditional Operator (`?.`):**
    The `employee?.Department?.Manager?.Name;` syntax performs a null check at each step of the chain.

    1.  **`employee?.`**: Checks if `employee` is `null`.
          * If `employee` is `null`, the entire expression immediately short-circuits and evaluates to `null`.
          * If `employee` is *not* `null`, it proceeds to the next part.
    2.  **`?.Department`**: After `employee` is confirmed non-null, it checks if `employee.Department` is `null`.
          * If `employee.Department` is `null`, the entire expression short-circuits to `null`.
          * If `employee.Department` is *not* `null`, it proceeds.
    3.  **`?.Manager`**: After `employee.Department` is confirmed non-null, it checks if `employee.Department.Manager` is `null`.
          * If `employee.Department.Manager` is `null`, the entire expression short-circuits to `null`.
          * If `employee.Department.Manager` is *not* `null`, it proceeds.
    4.  **`.Name`**: Finally, after all intermediate objects are confirmed non-null, `Name` is accessed.

**Result:**

  * If `employee` is `null`, `name` will be `null`.
  * If `employee` is not `null`, but `employee.Department` is `null`, `name` will be `null`.
  * If `employee` and `employee.Department` are not `null`, but `employee.Department.Manager` is `null`, `name` will be `null`.
  * Only if `employee`, `employee.Department`, *and* `employee.Department.Manager` are all non-`null` will `name` be assigned the actual value of `Manager.Name`.

**Type of `name`:** Since `Name` is likely a `string` (a reference type), `var name` will be inferred as `string`. If `Name` were a value type (e.g., `int`), `var name` would be inferred as `int?` (nullable int), because the null-conditional operator always results in a nullable type if the member itself is not a nullable type.

**Example Code:**

```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Department Department { get; set; }
}

public class Department
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Employee Manager { get; set; }
}

public class Manager
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class NestedPropertyAccess
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Employee emp1 = new Employee
        {
            Name = "Alice",
            Department = new Department
            {
                Name = "Sales",
                Manager = new Employee { Name = "Bob" }
            }
        };

        Employee emp2 = new Employee
        {
            Name = "Charlie",
            Department = new Department { Name = "Marketing", Manager = null } // No manager
        };

        Employee emp3 = new Employee
        {
            Name = "David",
            Department = null // No department
        };

        Employee emp4 = null; // Null employee object

        // Safe access using null-conditional operator
        string managerName1 = emp1?.Department?.Manager?.Name;
        Console.WriteLine($"Emp1 Manager: {managerName1 ?? "N/A"}"); // Output: Bob

        string managerName2 = emp2?.Department?.Manager?.Name;
        Console.WriteLine($"Emp2 Manager: {managerName2 ?? "N/A"}"); // Output: N/A (because Manager is null)

        string managerName3 = emp3?.Department?.Manager?.Name;
        Console.WriteLine($"Emp3 Manager: {managerName3 ?? "N/A"}"); // Output: N/A (because Department is null)

        string managerName4 = emp4?.Department?.Manager?.Name;
        Console.WriteLine($"Emp4 Manager: {managerName4 ?? "N/A"}"); // Output: N/A (because emp4 is null)
    }
}
```

This demonstrates how `?.` elegantly handles potential nulls in a chain, making the code much cleaner and less error-prone.

-----

### **3. How does the following behave?**

```csharp
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int c = a++ + ++b;
```

**Behavior Explanation:**

This example involves arithmetic operators along with the increment operators in both their postfix (`a++`) and prefix (`++b`) forms. Understanding their order of operation is key.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1.  **`int a = 5;`**: Variable `a` is initialized to `5`.

2.  **`int b = 10;`**: Variable `b` is initialized to `10`.

3.  **`int c = a++ + ++b;`**: This is the core expression. C\# evaluates operators based on their precedence and associativity.

      * **`a++` (Postfix Increment):**

          * The *current value* of `a` (which is `5`) is used in the expression.
          * **After** its value is used, `a` is incremented. So, `a` becomes `6`.
          * At this point, the left operand of `+` is `5`.

      * **`++b` (Prefix Increment):**

          * `b` is incremented **first**. So, `b` becomes `11`.
          * The *new value* of `b` (which is `11`) is then used in the expression.
          * At this point, the right operand of `+` is `11`.

      * **`+` (Addition):**

          * Now, the addition `5 + 11` is performed.
          * The result is `16`.

      * **`c = ...` (Assignment):**

          * The result `16` is assigned to `c`.

**Final State of Variables:**

  * `a` will be `6`
  * `b` will be `11`
  * `c` will be `16`

**Code to Verify:**

```csharp
public class IncrementOperatorBehavior
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int c = a++ + ++b;

        Console.WriteLine($"a: {a}"); // Output: 6
        Console.WriteLine($"b: {b}"); // Output: 11
        Console.WriteLine($"c: {c}"); // Output: 16
    }
}
```

This behavior highlights the crucial difference between prefix and postfix increment/decrement operators: whether the variable is updated *before* or *after* its value is used in the surrounding expression.

-----

### **4. When would you use bitwise operators in a real-world application?**

Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) manipulate individual bits of integer data. While less common in everyday business logic, they are powerful and essential in specific real-world scenarios.

Here are key use cases:

1.  **Flag Management (Enum Flags):**
    This is by far the most common real-world application. You can represent a set of boolean options or permissions using a single integer variable, where each bit corresponds to a specific flag. This is often done with `[Flags]` enums.

      * **Scenario:** User permissions, feature toggles, state tracking.
      * **How it works:**
          * Each flag is assigned a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).
          * `|` (Bitwise OR) to **combine** flags (set bits).
          * `&` (Bitwise AND) to **check** if a specific flag is set.
          * `~` (Bitwise NOT) or `^` (Bitwise XOR) to **remove/toggle** flags.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    [Flags]
    public enum AccessPermissions
    {
        None = 0,
        Read = 1 << 0,  // 1 (0001)
        Write = 1 << 1, // 2 (0010)
        Delete = 1 << 2, // 4 (0100)
        Admin = Read | Write | Delete // 7 (0111)
    }

    public class PermissionExample
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            AccessPermissions userPermissions = AccessPermissions.Read | AccessPermissions.Write; // User has Read and Write

            Console.WriteLine($"User Permissions: {userPermissions}"); // Output: Read, Write

            // Check if user has Read permission
            if ((userPermissions & AccessPermissions.Read) == AccessPermissions.Read)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("User has Read access.");
            }

            // Check if user has Delete permission
            if ((userPermissions & AccessPermissions.Delete) == AccessPermissions.Delete)
            {
    ```

WriteLine("User has Delete access."); // This won't print
}
else
{
Console.WriteLine("User does NOT have Delete access.");
}

````
        // Add Delete permission
        userPermissions |= AccessPermissions.Delete;
        Console.WriteLine($"New User Permissions: {userPermissions}"); // Output: Read, Write, Delete

        // Remove Write permission
        userPermissions &= ~AccessPermissions.Write;
        Console.WriteLine($"Permissions after removing Write: {userPermissions}"); // Output: Read, Delete
    }
}
```
````

2.  **Low-Level Data Manipulation / Serialization:**
    When dealing with binary protocols, hardware interfaces, or highly optimized data storage formats, you might need to pack or unpack data at the bit level.

      * **Scenario:** Networking protocols (parsing headers), file formats (reading/writing specific bit fields), embedded systems programming.
      * **How it works:** `<<` (left shift) and `>>` (right shift) are used to position bits, and `&` (AND) and `|` (OR) are used to extract or insert specific bit patterns.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    // Example: Packing two 8-bit values into a 16-bit integer
    byte highByte = 0xA1; // 10100001
    byte lowByte = 0xBC;  // 10111100

    ushort packedValue = (ushort)((highByte << 8) | lowByte); // Shift highByte 8 bits left, then OR with lowByte
    Console.WriteLine($"Packed Value: 0x{packedValue:X4}"); // Output: 0xA1BC

    // Example: Unpacking values
    byte extractedHigh = (byte)(packedValue >> 8); // Shift right 8 bits
    byte extractedLow = (byte)(packedValue & 0xFF); // Mask with 0xFF (0000 0000 1111 1111) to get lower 8 bits

    Console.WriteLine($"Extracted High Byte: 0x{extractedHigh:X2}"); // Output: 0xA1
    Console.WriteLine($"Extracted Low Byte: 0x{extractedLow:X2}");   // Output: 0xBC
    ```

3.  **Hashing Algorithms / Cryptography:**
    Many hashing functions and cryptographic algorithms rely heavily on bitwise operations for performance and to ensure good distribution and mixing of bits.

      * **Scenario:** Implementing custom hash functions, checksum calculations, cryptographic primitives.
      * **How it works:** XOR, shifts, and AND operations are used to permute bits in a non-linear fashion.

4.  **Performance Optimization:**
    In very performance-critical sections of code, bitwise operations can sometimes be faster than arithmetic operations for certain tasks (e.g., multiplying/dividing by powers of 2, checking even/odd).

      * **Scenario:** Game development (fast math), tight loops in data processing.
      * **How it works:**
          * `x << n` is equivalent to `x * (2^n)`.
          * `x >> n` is equivalent to `x / (2^n)` (integer division).
          * `x & 1` checks if `x` is odd (returns 1 if odd, 0 if even).

    <!-- end list -->

    ```csharp
    // Fast multiplication by 8
    int num = 7;
    int multiplied = num << 3; // 7 * 2^3 = 7 * 8 = 56
    Console.WriteLine($"7 << 3 = {multiplied}"); // Output: 56

    // Check if number is even/odd
    int checkNum = 15;
    if ((checkNum & 1) == 0) // If the least significant bit is 0, it's even
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{checkNum} is even.");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{checkNum} is odd."); // Output: 15 is odd.
    }
    ```

5.  **Graphics and Image Processing:**
    Pixel manipulation often involves bitwise operations to extract or combine color components (e.g., Red, Green, Blue, Alpha channels) from a single integer representing a pixel.

      * **Scenario:** Custom image filters, color conversions.
      * **How it works:** Shifting and masking to isolate specific byte (color) components.

In summary, while not universally applicable, bitwise operators are indispensable tools for low-level programming, optimization, and working with binary data structures and flags.

### **5. Explain how compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) work under the hood.**

Compound assignment operators (like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`, `??=`) are syntactic sugar provided by C\# (and many other languages) to make code more concise and often more readable.

**Under the hood, a compound assignment `x op= y` is generally equivalent to `x = x op y;` with an important nuance related to type conversion and single evaluation of `x`.**

Let's break down the mechanics:

#### **Simple Case: No Type Conversion Issues**

For primitive types where `x` and `y` are of compatible types (e.g., `int x; int y; x += y;`), the compiler essentially translates:

`x op= y;`

into:

`x = x op y;`

**Example:**

```csharp
int a = 10;
int b = 5;
a += b; // This is translated to: a = a + b;
// a becomes 15
```

#### **Important Nuance: Implicit Type Conversion / Casting**

This is where compound assignment operators differ slightly from their expanded form, and it's a key advantage. When `x` and `y` have different types, the expanded form `x = x op y;` might require an explicit cast, whereas the compound assignment operator often handles it implicitly, provided the operation is valid.

**Consider `x op= y;`:**

  * The operation (`op`) is performed using the **widened type** of `x` and `y` (the larger or more precise type).
  * The *result* of this operation is then **implicitly converted/cast back to the type of `x`** before assignment, *if* an implicit conversion exists and is safe. If not, a compile-time error occurs.

**Example: `byte += int`**

```csharp
byte x = 10;
int y = 20;

// Using compound assignment:
x += y; // This compiles successfully!
        // Behind the scenes: (int)x + y => 10 + 20 = 30.
        // Then, the result (30) is implicitly cast back to byte.
        // byte x = (byte)(x + y); // This is what the compiler effectively does for you.
Console.WriteLine(x); // Output: 30
```

Now, let's try the expanded form:

```csharp
byte x = 10;
int y = 20;

// Expanded form - this will NOT compile:
// x = x + y; // Compile-time error: "Cannot implicitly convert type 'int' to 'byte'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)"

// To make the expanded form compile, you need an explicit cast:
x = (byte)(x + y); // This works
Console.WriteLine(x); // Output: 30
```

**Why this difference?**
The C\# language specification specifically defines compound assignment operators to include this implicit conversion back to the original type of the left-hand operand, provided the operation is legal. This is a convenience feature to reduce verbosity, especially when working with smaller integral types (like `byte`, `short`) where arithmetic operations often promote to `int`.

#### **Important Nuance 2: Single Evaluation of `x`**

Another subtle but important point is that the left-hand operand (`x`) is evaluated only **once** in a compound assignment. This matters if `x` is a complex expression (e.g., an indexer or a property getter) that might have side effects or be computationally expensive.

**Example: Property with Side Effect**

```csharp
public class MyObject
{
    private int _value;
    public int Value
    {
        get
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Getting Value...");
            return _value;
        }
        set
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Setting Value...");
            _value = value;
        }
    }

    public MyObject(int val) { _value = val; }
}

public class CompoundAssignmentUnderTheHood
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        MyObject obj = new MyObject(10);
        int increment = 5;

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Using += operator ---");
        obj.Value += increment; // "Getting Value..." (1 time) then "Setting Value..." (1 time)
        Console.WriteLine($"New Value: {obj.Value}");

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Equivalent expanded form ---");
        // This would involve two 'gets' and one 'set' if not careful
        // obj.Value = obj.Value + increment; // "Getting Value..." (1 time) then "Getting Value..." (2nd time)
                                              // then "Setting Value..." (1 time)
    }
}
```

If the compiler simply expanded `obj.Value += increment;` to `obj.Value = obj.Value + increment;` directly, the `Value` getter would be invoked twice. However, compound assignments ensure the left-hand side is evaluated only once, then the operation is performed, and the result is assigned. This guarantees consistent behavior and efficiency for complex left-hand expressions.

**In summary:**

Compound assignment operators:

1.  Are a syntactic shorthand for `x = x op y;`.
2.  Crucially, they include an implicit cast back to the type of `x` if `x op y` would result in a different, compatible type.
3.  Ensure the left-hand operand `x` is evaluated only once, preventing redundant calculations or unintended side effects from complex expressions.

### **6. Write a function that checks if a number is a power of 2 using bitwise operators.**

A number is a power of 2 if and only if it has exactly one bit set to `1` in its binary representation. (e.g., 1 (0001), 2 (0010), 4 (0100), 8 (1000)).

There's a clever bitwise trick to check this:

**The Trick:**
If `n` is a power of 2, then `n` will have only one bit set.
If you subtract 1 from `n` (`n - 1`), all the bits to the right of that single set bit will become `1`, and that single set bit will become `0`.

**Example:**

  * `n = 8` (binary `1000`)
  * `n - 1 = 7` (binary `0111`)

Now, if you perform a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between `n` and `n - 1`:

  * `n & (n - 1)`
  * `1000 & 0111`
  * The result is `0000` (which is 0).

This pattern holds true for all powers of 2. For any other number (not a power of 2, or 0):

**Example (Not a power of 2):**

  * `n = 6` (binary `0110`)
  * `n - 1 = 5` (binary `0101`)
  * `n & (n - 1)` = `0110 & 0101` = `0100` (which is 4, not 0)

**Special Case: `0`**
The number 0 is not considered a power of 2. Our trick `n & (n-1)` would yield `0 & (-1)` which is `0`. So we need to handle 0 explicitly.

**The Function:**

```csharp
using System;

public class BitwisePowerOfTwo
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Checks if a given integer is a power of 2 using bitwise operators.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="n">The integer to check.</param>
    /// <returns>True if n is a power of 2 (and n > 0), otherwise false.</returns>
    public static bool IsPowerOfTwo(int n)
    {
        // A number is a power of 2 if:
        // 1. It is greater than 0 (powers of 2 are always positive).
        // 2. It has only one bit set to 1 in its binary representation.
        //    The trick for this is (n & (n - 1)) == 0.
        //    If n has only one bit set, n-1 will have all bits to its right set, and that bit will be 0.
        //    Performing bitwise AND will then result in 0.
        return (n > 0) && ((n & (n - 1)) == 0);
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 1 a power of 2? {IsPowerOfTwo(1)}");   // True (0001)
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 2 a power of 2? {IsPowerOfTwo(2)}");   // True (0010)
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 4 a power of 2? {IsPowerOfTwo(4)}");   // True (0100)
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 8 a power of 2? {IsPowerOfTwo(8)}");   // True (1000)
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 16 a power of 2? {IsPowerOfTwo(16)}"); // True (10000)
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 0 a power of 2? {IsPowerOfTwo(0)}");   // False (handles n > 0 check)
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 3 a power of 2? {IsPowerOfTwo(3)}");   // False (0011)
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 6 a power of 2? {IsPowerOfTwo(6)}");   // False (0110)
        Console.WriteLine($"Is 7 a power of 2? {IsPowerOfTwo(7)}");   // False (0111)
        Console.WriteLine($"Is -2 a power of 2? {IsPowerOfTwo(-2)}"); // False (handles n > 0 check)
    }
}
```

This function is very efficient because bitwise operations are typically fast, operating directly on the hardware level.

-----

### **7. How would you use the `is` and `as` operators in practice?**

The `is` and `as` operators are both used for type checking and safe casting in C\#. They are primarily used when you have an `object` (or a variable of a base type) and you need to determine if it's compatible with a more specific (derived) type, and then potentially cast it.

#### **`is` Operator**

The `is` operator checks if an object is compatible with a given type and returns a boolean (`true` or `false`). It doesn't perform a cast itself, but in modern C\# (7.0+), it's commonly used with **pattern matching** to perform a check and a cast in one go.

**Use Cases for `is`:**

1.  **Simple Type Check (before C\# 7.0 or just needing a boolean):**

    ```csharp
    public void ProcessAnimal(object animal)
    {
        if (animal is Dog) // Check if 'animal' is a Dog or derived from Dog
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is a dog!");
        }
        else if (animal is Cat)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is a cat!");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is some other animal.");
        }
    }

2.  **Type Checking with Pattern Matching (C\# 7.0+ - Recommended for "check and cast"):**
    This is the most common and powerful way to use `is` now. It attempts to cast the expression to the specified type and, if successful, assigns it to a new variable of that type within the scope of the `if` or `switch` statement.

    ```csharp
    public class Animal { }
    public class Dog : Animal { public void Bark() => Console.WriteLine("Woof!"); }
    public class Cat : Animal { public void Meow() => Console.WriteLine("Meow!"); }

    public void ProcessAnimalSafely(object animal)
    {
        if (animal is Dog dog) // 'animal' is Dog, and assign it to 'dog' variable
        {
            dog.Bark(); // Can now call Dog-specific methods
        }
        else if (animal is Cat cat) // 'animal' is Cat, and assign it to 'cat' variable
        {
            cat.Meow(); // Can now call Cat-specific methods
        }
        else if (animal is string s) // Can check for any type, even unrelated
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Got a string: {s}");
        }
        else if (animal == null) // Check for null explicitly if needed (is operator handles null for you mostly)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Got a null object.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Got an unknown type: {animal.GetType().Name}");
        }
    }
    ```

#### **`as` Operator**

The `as` operator attempts to perform a cast. If the cast is successful, it returns the casted object; if the cast fails, it returns `null` instead of throwing an `InvalidCastException`.

**Use Cases for `as`:**

1.  **Safe Casting of Reference Types:** This is its primary use. When you are uncertain if an object is of a particular reference type (or a type derived from it), `as` prevents crashes.

    ```csharp
    public class Logger
    {
        public void LogMessage(object message)
        {
            string logString = message as string; // Try to cast message to string

            if (logString != null)
            {
                // It was a string, log it directly
                Console.WriteLine($"LOG: {logString}");
            }
            else
            {
                // It was not a string, use its ToString() representation
                Console.WriteLine($"LOG (Object): {message?.ToString() ?? "null"}");
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Casting to Nullable Value Types:** `as` can also be used to cast to nullable value types (e.g., `int?`).

    ```csharp
    object objInt = 123;
    object objString = "hello";

    int? num = objInt as int?; // num is 123
    Console.WriteLine($"Casted int: {num ?? -1}");

    num = objString as int?; // num is null
    Console.WriteLine($"Casted string to int?: {num ?? -1}");
    ```

3.  **When you want to proceed conditionally after a failed cast, but `null` is a valid outcome.**

#### **`is` vs. `as` - When to Choose Which:**

| Feature               | `is` Operator (and Pattern Matching)                          | `as` Operator                                                |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | **Check type AND (optionally) cast** (C\# 7.0+ patterns)     | **Attempt cast**, return `null` on failure                   |
| **Result on Failure** | `false` (for `is`)                                            | `null`                                                       |
| **Throws Exception?** | No                                                            | No                                                           |
| **Applicable To** | Any type (reference, value, nullable value)                   | **Reference types** and **nullable value types** only. Cannot be used for non-nullable value types like `int` directly (must be `int?`). |
| **Common Use** | Conditional logic (`if`, `switch`) where you need to perform actions specific to a type. Often preferred for conciseness. | When you expect `null` on failure, and you're working primarily with reference types or nullable structs. |
| **Syntactic Style** | `if (obj is Type targetVar)`                                | `Type targetVar = obj as Type;` then `if (targetVar != null)` |

#### **Combined Practical Example:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public interface IShape { }
public class Circle : IShape { public double Radius { get; set; } }
public class Square : IShape { public double Side { get; set; } }
public class Triangle : IShape { public double Base { get; set; } public double Height { get; set; } }

public class OperatorUsage
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<object> items = new List<object>
        {
            new Circle { Radius = 5.0 },
            "Hello",
            new Square { Side = 10.0 },
            null,
            new Triangle { Base = 4.0, Height = 3.0 },
            123
        };

        foreach (var item in items)
        {
            Console.Write($"Processing item of type {item?.GetType().Name ?? "null"}: ");

            // --- Using 'is' with pattern matching (modern, concise, often preferred) ---
            if (item is Circle circle)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"It's a Circle with radius {circle.Radius}");
            }
            else if (item is Square square)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"It's a Square with side {square.Side}");
            }
            else if (item is string s) // Can check for unrelated types too
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"It's a String: '{s.ToUpper()}'");
            }
            // You can also use 'is' for non-nullable value types
            else if (item is int i)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"It's an Int: {i}");
            }
            // else if (item is IShape shape) // General interface check
            // {
            //     Console.WriteLine($"It's a general shape.");
            // }
            else if (item == null) // Explicit null check is still good practice for clarity
            {
                 Console.WriteLine("It's explicitly null.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"It's an unknown object.");
            }

            // --- Using 'as' (when you expect null or need the reference) ---
            // Example where 'as' might be useful, although 'is' pattern matching covers it
            var shapeAsCircle = item as Circle; // Will be Circle object or null
            if (shapeAsCircle != null)
            {
                // Do something specific with shapeAsCircle if it's a Circle
                // Console.WriteLine($"(Using 'as'): Found Circle with radius {shapeAsCircle.Radius}");
            }

            Console.WriteLine("---");
        }
    }
}
```

In modern C\#, `is` with pattern matching (`if (obj is Type var)`) is often preferred because it combines the type check and the cast into a single, highly readable operation, reducing boilerplate code compared to `as` followed by a `null` check. However, `as` remains valuable when you specifically want a `null` result on failure and are working strictly with reference types or nullable value types.
