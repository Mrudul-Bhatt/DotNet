### You have a `ReportGenerator` class that directly instantiates a `DatabaseConnection` class. This makes unit testing difficult. Show how you would refactor this code to adhere to the Dependency Inversion Principle, and then write a simple unit test for the refactored `ReportGenerator` class using a mock.

**Answer:**

The original code violates the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** because the high-level `ReportGenerator` module directly depends on the low-level `DatabaseConnection` class. To fix this, you must introduce an abstraction (an interface) that both classes can depend on.

**Refactoring for DIP:**

1.  **Create an Abstraction:** Define an interface for the database connection.

<!-- end list -->

```csharp
public interface IDatabaseConnection
{
    string GetData(string query);
}
```

2.  **Make `DatabaseConnection` Implement the Interface:** Modify the concrete low-level class to implement the new interface.

<!-- end list -->

```csharp
public class DatabaseConnection : IDatabaseConnection
{
    public string GetData(string query)
    {
        // Actual logic to connect to a database and retrieve data
        return "Data from real database";
    }
}
```

3.  **Inject the Dependency:** Change the `ReportGenerator` to accept the `IDatabaseConnection` through its constructor (this is a form of Dependency Injection).

<!-- end list -->

```csharp
public class ReportGenerator
{
    private readonly IDatabaseConnection _dbConnection;

    public ReportGenerator(IDatabaseConnection dbConnection)
    {
        _dbConnection = dbConnection;
    }

    public string GenerateReport(string query)
    {
        string data = _dbConnection.GetData(query);
        // Logic to format the report
        return $"Report based on: {data}";
    }
}
```

**Unit Test with a Mock:**

Now, you can use a mock framework like Moq to create a fake `IDatabaseConnection` for testing purposes.

```csharp
using Xunit;
using Moq;

public class ReportGeneratorTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void GenerateReport_WithData_ReturnsFormattedReport()
    {
        // Arrange
        var mockDbConnection = new Mock<IDatabaseConnection>();
        string expectedData = "Mocked Data";
        
        // Setup the mock to return specific data when GetData is called
        mockDbConnection.Setup(db => db.GetData(It.IsAny<string>()))
                        .Returns(expectedData);

        var reportGenerator = new ReportGenerator(mockDbConnection.Object);

        // Act
        string result = reportGenerator.GenerateReport("SELECT * FROM Reports");

        // Assert
        Assert.Contains(expectedData, result);
    }
}
```

By inverting the dependency, the `ReportGenerator` is no longer tied to a specific database implementation, making it easy to test in isolation by providing a mock object.

### Discuss a real-world scenario from your own experience where adhering to a specific SOLID principle saved you significant time or effort in the long run.

**Answer:**

A great example from my experience involved refactoring a complex payment processing system using the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**. Initially, the system had a single `PaymentProcessor` class with a massive `switch` statement to handle different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, bank transfer).

When a new payment method, like Bitcoin, needed to be added, we had to modify the `PaymentProcessor` class. This was a risky change; every time we touched that class, we risked introducing bugs into the existing, stable payment methods. It required a full suite of regression tests for all payment types, which was time-consuming.

After refactoring, we created an `IPaymentMethod` interface. Each payment type (e.g., `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`) became a new class that implemented this interface. The `PaymentProcessor` was then simplified to accept any `IPaymentMethod` and call its `Process()` method.

When the new Bitcoin payment method was required, we simply created a new `BitcoinPayment` class that implemented the `IPaymentMethod` interface. We did not need to touch the existing `PaymentProcessor` or any of the other payment classes. We only needed to test the new `BitcoinPayment` class. This approach saved immense time and effort and greatly reduced the risk of breaking existing functionality, proving OCP's value for building extensible systems.

### How do design patterns like Strategy, Decorator, or Factory Method relate to and help enforce SOLID principles? Provide an example.

**Answer:**

Design patterns are often practical implementations of SOLID principles. They provide a structured way to solve common design problems while adhering to these principles.

  * **Strategy Pattern and OCP:** The **Strategy pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It directly enforces the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**. A client can use different algorithms (strategies) without being modified. For instance, the payment system example above is a perfect use case for the Strategy pattern.

  * **Decorator Pattern and OCP:** The **Decorator pattern** allows behavior to be added to an individual object dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It enforces **OCP** by allowing you to extend an object's functionality without modifying its core class.

  * **Factory Method and DIP:** The **Factory Method pattern** defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern enforces the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** by ensuring that the client code depends on an abstraction (the factory interface) rather than a concrete class.

**Example: Factory Method and DIP**

Consider a logging system. Instead of directly instantiating a `FileLogger`, a `ConsoleLogger`, or a `DatabaseLogger`, you can use a factory.

```csharp
// Abstraction (Interface for logging)
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

// Low-level modules (Concrete implementations)
public class FileLogger : ILogger { /* ... */ }
public class ConsoleLogger : ILogger { /* ... */ }

// Abstraction (Interface for the factory)
public interface ILoggerFactory
{
    ILogger CreateLogger();
}

// High-level module (Client) depends on the factory abstraction
public class Application
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;
    
    public Application(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
    {
        _logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger(); // Factory creates the instance
    }
    
    public void Run()
    {
        _logger.Log("Application started.");
    }
}
```

The `Application` class depends only on `ILoggerFactory` and `ILogger`, which are abstractions, thus adhering to DIP. The client can use a `FileLoggerFactory` or `ConsoleLoggerFactory` to get the appropriate logger without changing the `Application` class.

### You are working on a legacy codebase that heavily violates SOLID principles. What's your strategy for refactoring it? Which principle would you start with, and why?

**Answer:**

Refactoring a legacy codebase that violates SOLID principles requires a cautious, incremental strategy. You shouldn't attempt a full-scale rewrite. The goal is to make small, safe changes that improve the design over time.

**My Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze and Identify Hotspots:** I'd start by identifying the most problematic areas of the codebase. I would look for classes that are very large, have many dependencies, are difficult to test, or have been a source of frequent bugs. These "hotspots" are where refactoring will have the most impact.

2.  **Write Tests First:** Before any refactoring, I would write new unit tests for the existing, problematic code to understand its behavior and ensure that my changes don't break anything. This creates a safety net.

3.  **Refactor Incrementally:** I'd apply the principles one by one, focusing on a single, isolated problem at a time. The "boy scout rule" applies here: "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it."

4.  **Prioritize and Communicate:** I'd prioritize refactoring tasks based on the value they provide. It's crucial to communicate these efforts to the team to ensure everyone is on the same page.

**Starting Principle:**

I would start with the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.

**Why SRP First?**

  * **It's the Foundation:** SRP is often considered the most fundamental of the SOLID principles. Many violations of other principles, like OCP, ISP, and DIP, are a direct result of a class having too many responsibilities. A large, multi-purpose class is hard to extend (violates OCP), likely has a "fat" interface (violates ISP), and will have many dependencies (violates DIP).

  * **Easier to Implement:** Separating responsibilities is often a straightforward refactoring. You can create new classes and move methods and their corresponding dependencies with minimal risk, especially if you have good tests.

  * **High Impact:** By breaking down a large, monolithic class into smaller, more focused classes, you immediately improve code clarity, testability, and maintainability. It makes the code easier to understand for both current and future developers, setting the stage for subsequent, more complex refactorings related to other SOLID principles. Once SRP is addressed, tackling OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP becomes much easier.
