Excellent — here are **interview-ready answers** for each of your inheritance-related questions in **C# / OOP**:

---

### ✅ **1. What is Inheritance in OOP? What is its primary purpose?**

**Answer:**
Inheritance is an OOP concept where a **derived class** inherits members (fields, methods, properties) from a **base class**.
It promotes:

* **Code reusability**: Common behavior is defined once in the base class.
* **Hierarchy modeling**: Helps establish relationships between general and specialized types.

**Example:**

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public void Eat() => Console.WriteLine("Animal eats.");
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark() => Console.WriteLine("Dog barks.");
}
```

### ✅ **2. What is the "is-a" relationship in the context of inheritance?**

**Answer:**
The “is-a” relationship describes when a derived class is a **specialized version** of a base class.

**Examples:**

* A `Car` **is a** `Vehicle`
* A `Dog` **is an** `Animal`

In C#:

```csharp
Car myCar = new Car();
Vehicle v = myCar; // Valid — Car is a Vehicle
```

This enables polymorphism and type substitution.

### ✅ **3. Does C# support multiple inheritance of classes? Why or why not?**

**Answer:**
No, C# **does not support multiple inheritance of classes**.

**Why?**
To avoid complexity and ambiguity, especially the **Diamond Problem**, where a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base.

**How to achieve similar behavior?**

* **Interfaces**: A class can implement multiple interfaces.
* **Composition**: Use other classes as members instead of inheriting.

**Example using interfaces:**

```csharp
public interface IReadable { void Read(); }
public interface IWritable { void Write(); }

public class File : IReadable, IWritable
{
    public void Read() { }
    public void Write() { }
}
```

### ✅ **4. What is the purpose of the `base` keyword in C# inheritance?**

**Answer:**
The `base` keyword is used to access members of the **base class** from a **derived class**.

**Use cases:**

* Call base class **constructor**
* Call **overridden methods**
* Access **hidden properties or fields**

**Example:**

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Animal speaks");
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        base.Speak(); // Calls Animal.Speak
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

### ✅ **5. Method Overriding vs Method Hiding (`new` keyword)**

| Feature      | Overriding                                            | Hiding (`new`)                                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keywords     | `virtual` + `override`                                | `new`                                                                   |
| Polymorphism | **Yes** (runtime-based)                               | **No** (compile-time-based)                                             |
| Behavior     | Replaces base method when accessed via base reference | Hides it only in derived class context                                  |
| Use Case     | When you want **true polymorphism**                   | When method is **semantically different** or base method is not virtual |

**Example:**

```csharp
public class BaseClass
{
    public virtual void Show() => Console.WriteLine("Base Show");
    public void Display() => Console.WriteLine("Base Display");
}

public class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public override void Show() => Console.WriteLine("Derived Show"); // Overriding
    public new void Display() => Console.WriteLine("Derived Display"); // Hiding
}
```

**Usage:**

```csharp
BaseClass obj = new DerivedClass();
obj.Show();   // "Derived Show" (Overriding)
obj.Display(); // "Base Display" (Hiding)
```

---

### ✅ **6. What is the `sealed` keyword? When and why would you use it?**

**Answer:**
The `sealed` keyword:

* **Prevents further inheritance** of a class
* **Prevents method overriding** when applied to a method

**Usage Scenarios:**

* To **secure** class logic
* To **optimize performance** (JIT may inline sealed methods)
* To **restrict customization** in APIs

**Examples:**

```csharp
public sealed class FinalClass { } // Cannot be inherited

public class Base
{
    public virtual void DoWork() { }
}

public class Derived : Base
{
    public sealed override void DoWork() { } // Cannot be overridden further
}
```
