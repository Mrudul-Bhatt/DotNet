Here's a detailed, interview-ready response for each **Abstraction-related** question in **Question → Answer** format:

---

### ✅ **Question 1:**

**What is Abstraction in OOP? How does it differ from Encapsulation?**

---

### ✅ **Answer 1:**

**Abstraction** is the OOP principle of exposing only **essential features** while hiding the **implementation details**. It answers the question:
👉 *“**What** does the object do?”*
—not how it does it.

**Encapsulation**, on the other hand, is about **hiding the internal state** and protecting it via access modifiers. It focuses on *“**How** is the data protected or accessed?”*

| Aspect    | Abstraction                         | Encapsulation                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Purpose   | Hides **implementation complexity** | Hides **internal data**             |
| Focus     | "What" an object does               | "How" an object maintains integrity |
| Level     | Design level                        | Implementation level                |
| Mechanism | Interfaces, abstract classes        | Access modifiers (private, public)  |

### ✅ **Question 2:**

**What are the two main mechanisms to achieve Abstraction in C#?**

---

### ✅ **Answer 2:**

Abstraction in C# is achieved using:

1. **Abstract Classes**
2. **Interfaces**

Both define **contracts** for behavior, but they differ in how they allow implementation and inheritance.

---

### ✅ **Question 3:**

**Explain Abstract Classes in C#. What are their characteristics? When would you use one?**

---

### ✅ **Answer 3:**

An **abstract class** is a class that:

* **Cannot be instantiated** directly
* Can contain **abstract methods** (no implementation)
* Can also contain **concrete methods** (with implementation)
* Can have **fields, constructors**, and **access modifiers**
* Supports **inheritance** (only **one** abstract class can be inherited)

**Use when:**

* You want a **common base** for related classes
* You need to **share code** across subclasses
* You want to **enforce a contract** via abstract members

**Example:**

```csharp
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double CalculateArea(); // Must be overridden
    public void Display() => Console.WriteLine("Displaying shape");
}
```

---

### ✅ **Question 4:**

**Explain Interfaces in C#. What are their characteristics? When would you use one?**

---

### ✅ **Answer 4:**

An **interface** in C#:

* Declares **method/property/event signatures**
* **Cannot contain fields or constructors**
* **Cannot be instantiated**
* A class can implement **multiple interfaces**
* From C# 8.0, interfaces can define **default method implementations**

**Use when:**

* You want to define **capabilities or roles** (`IPrintable`, `IDisposable`)
* You need **multiple inheritance of behavior**
* Classes implementing the interface may come from **unrelated hierarchies**

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}

public class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
}
```

---

### ✅ **Question 5:**

**What are the key differences between an Abstract Class and an Interface in C#? When should you choose one over the other?**

---

### ✅ **Answer 5:**

| Feature        | Abstract Class                         | Interface                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Instantiation  | Cannot be instantiated                 | Cannot be instantiated                                   |
| Inheritance    | Single inheritance                     | Multiple interfaces can be implemented                   |
| Members        | Can have fields, properties, methods   | Cannot have fields (except static from C# 8.0)           |
| Implementation | Can have both abstract & concrete code | Traditionally no implementation (C# 8.0+ allows default) |
| Constructors   | Yes                                    | No                                                       |

**Choose Abstract Class when:**

* Classes are **closely related**
* You want to share **implementation and state**

**Choose Interface when:**

* Classes may be **unrelated**
* You want to define **capabilities**
* You need **multiple inheritance of contract**

Think of it as:

* **"Is-a"** → use abstract class
* **"Can-do"** → use interface

---

### ✅ **Question 6:**

**What is the purpose of an abstract method in C#?**

---

### ✅ **Answer 6:**

An **abstract method** is:

* Declared inside an **abstract class**
* Has **no body** (no implementation)
* Must be **overridden** in any **non-abstract derived class**

**Purpose:**

* To **enforce** that derived classes **must implement** specific behavior.
* Enables **runtime polymorphism** by defining a common interface with variable implementations.

**Example:**

```csharp
public abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void MakeSound(); // Must be overridden
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound() => Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
}
```
