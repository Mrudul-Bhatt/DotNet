Got it — I’ll keep the **"Question first → Answer"** style with clear explanations and code snippets.

### **1. Explain a scenario where a Scoped service lifetime is the most appropriate choice. For example, consider a web request context.**

**Answer:**
A **Scoped** service lifetime is ideal when you want a **single instance of a service per HTTP request** but different instances across different requests.
Example: In a web API, you might have a `DbContext` that should be reused for the duration of the request to ensure all database operations are tracked and committed in one unit of work.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
// Registration
builder.Services.AddScoped<ApplicationDbContext>();

// Usage in a controller
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _dbContext;

    public ProductsController(ApplicationDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetProducts()
    {
        var products = _dbContext.Products.ToList();
        return Ok(products);
    }
}
```

Here, `ApplicationDbContext` is shared for all code handling the same HTTP request but is disposed of after the request completes.

### **2. You're working on a web application and need a configuration service. Should it be a Transient, Scoped, or Singleton? Justify your choice.**

**Answer:**
It should be a **Singleton**.
Configuration values rarely change during the lifetime of the application, so there’s no need to create new instances each time. Using Singleton reduces memory allocations and ensures consistency.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
public interface IAppConfig
{
    string ApiBaseUrl { get; }
}

public class AppConfig : IAppConfig
{
    public string ApiBaseUrl { get; } = "https://api.example.com";
}

// Register as Singleton
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IAppConfig, AppConfig>();
```

Since configuration is immutable, Singleton is safe and efficient.

### **3. Describe a real-world project you've worked on where DI was crucial. What were the challenges, and what benefits did it provide to your team?**

**Answer:**
In our **Sage Truck Driving School portal integration**, DI was essential for managing dependencies like **logging**, **repository services**, and **external API clients**.

**Challenges:**

* Multiple services depended on the same data context.
* Some services needed to call third-party APIs, which required mock implementations for testing.
* Avoiding tight coupling between controllers and repositories.

**Benefits:**

* Easy to swap real implementations with mocks during unit testing.
* Better separation of concerns (controllers did not care about how data was retrieved).
* Simplified configuration for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
* Improved maintainability — adding new services was straightforward.

### **4. You have a class that needs to create multiple instances of a dependent service within a single method call. How would you design your DI to handle this scenario, and what would you inject into the class? (Hint: Think about injecting a factory.)**

**Answer:**
For this scenario, you should inject a **factory** that can create new instances of the dependent service on demand, instead of injecting a single pre-created instance.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
public interface IReportGenerator
{
    void Generate();
}

public class ReportGenerator : IReportGenerator
{
    public void Generate()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Report Generated");
    }
}

// Factory delegate
public delegate IReportGenerator ReportGeneratorFactory();

public class ReportService
{
    private readonly ReportGeneratorFactory _reportFactory;

    public ReportService(ReportGeneratorFactory reportFactory)
    {
        _reportFactory = reportFactory;
    }

    public void GenerateMultipleReports(int count)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        {
            var generator = _reportFactory(); // New instance each time
            generator.Generate();
        }
    }
}

// Registration
builder.Services.AddTransient<IReportGenerator, ReportGenerator>();
builder.Services.AddTransient<ReportGeneratorFactory>(sp =>
    () => sp.GetRequiredService<IReportGenerator>());
```

Here, `ReportService` can request multiple fresh instances of `IReportGenerator` in the same method without them sharing state.

If you want, I can also **extend these answers into "product-company-ready" depth** with additional **follow-up interview question traps** for each. That way, you’ll be ready for deeper probing.
