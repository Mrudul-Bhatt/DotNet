Alright — let’s go question-by-question in a clear **interview-style** format with examples.

### **1. What are the three main service lifetimes in a .NET Core DI container? Explain the difference between Transient, Scoped, and Singleton, and provide a use case for each.**

**Answer:**
In ASP.NET Core’s built-in Dependency Injection container, there are **three service lifetimes**:

| Lifetime      | Description                                                           | Use Case                                                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transient** | A new instance is created **every time** the service is requested.    | Lightweight, stateless services. Example: `EmailSender` service.        |
| **Scoped**    | A single instance is created **per request (scope)**.                 | Services that hold request-specific data like repositories in web apps. |
| **Singleton** | A single instance is created **for the lifetime of the application**. | Caching services, configuration readers.                                |

**Example:**

```csharp
// Registration
services.AddTransient<IEmailService, EmailService>();  // New per call
services.AddScoped<IUserRepository, UserRepository>(); // One per HTTP request
services.AddSingleton<ICacheService, MemoryCacheService>(); // One for app lifetime
```

### **2. Explain the concept of an interface-based dependency. Why is it considered a best practice to inject an interface rather than a concrete class?**

**Answer:**
An **interface-based dependency** means you inject an abstraction (`IService`) instead of a concrete class (`Service`).

**Why it’s best practice:**

* **Loose Coupling:** The dependent class only knows about the interface, not the implementation.
* **Testability:** You can easily swap the real implementation for a mock or fake in unit tests.
* **Flexibility:** Different implementations can be provided without changing the consuming code.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface INotificationService
{
    void Send(string message);
}

public class EmailNotificationService : INotificationService
{
    public void Send(string message) => Console.WriteLine($"Email: {message}");
}

public class UserController
{
    private readonly INotificationService _notificationService;
    public UserController(INotificationService notificationService)
    {
        _notificationService = notificationService;
    }
}
```

### **3. What is the difference between DI and a Service Locator? Why is DI generally preferred over the Service Locator pattern?**

**Answer:**

* **Dependency Injection (DI):**
  Dependencies are **provided** to a class through its constructor, properties, or methods.
* **Service Locator:**
  The class **asks** for dependencies from a global object (`ServiceLocator.GetService<T>()`).

**Why DI is preferred:**

* **Explicitness:** Dependencies are clearly visible in constructors.
* **Testability:** No need for global service state; easy to mock.
* **Adherence to SOLID (DIP):** DI follows Dependency Inversion Principle; Service Locator hides dependencies, making code harder to understand and test.

**Example — Service Locator (Not Recommended):**

```csharp
var service = ServiceLocator.GetService<INotificationService>();
service.Send("Hello");
```

**Example — DI (Preferred):**

```csharp
public class UserController
{
    private readonly INotificationService _notificationService;
    public UserController(INotificationService notificationService)
    {
        _notificationService = notificationService;
    }
}
```

### **4. How does DI relate to the SOLID principles, specifically the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)?**

**Answer:**

* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** states:
  *"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."*
* DI implements DIP by:

  * Forcing classes to depend on **interfaces (abstractions)** rather than **concrete implementations**.
  * Moving the responsibility of providing dependencies to a **composition root** (like `Program.cs` in ASP.NET Core).

**Example — Without DIP:**

```csharp
public class OrderService
{
    private readonly SqlOrderRepository _repository = new SqlOrderRepository();
}
```

(Tightly coupled — changes in repository implementation affect `OrderService`.)

**Example — With DIP (via DI):**

```csharp
public class OrderService
{
    private readonly IOrderRepository _repository;
    public OrderService(IOrderRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }
}
```

(Loosely coupled — any `IOrderRepository` implementation can be injected.)

If you want, I can also prepare **one visual diagram** showing how DI lifetimes, interfaces, and DIP fit together for interviews. That would make it much easier to recall under pressure.
