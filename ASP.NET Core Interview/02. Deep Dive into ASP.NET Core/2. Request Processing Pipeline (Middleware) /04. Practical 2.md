Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs go step by step with **Q & A format**, targeting a **3‚Äì5 yrs Software Engineer** level.

---

## **1. Q: Describe a scenario where a piece of middleware needs access to a service from the Dependency Injection (DI) container. How would you inject this service into the middleware's InvokeAsync method?**

**A:**
Middleware often needs services like `ILogger`, `DbContext`, or `ICacheService`. Since middleware is created **once per application lifetime**, constructor injection is the recommended way to access services from the DI container.

**Scenario Example:** Middleware that logs requests using `ILogger<T>`.

**Code:**

```csharp
public class LoggingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<LoggingMiddleware> _logger;

    public LoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<LoggingMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Handling request: {Path}", context.Request.Path);
        await _next(context);
        _logger.LogInformation("Finished handling request.");
    }
}
```

**Register in Program.cs**

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseMiddleware<LoggingMiddleware>();

app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

‚úÖ **Key Point:** You don‚Äôt pass services into `InvokeAsync` directly ‚Äî instead, you inject them via the **constructor**, because middleware is resolved by DI just like controllers.

---

## **2. Q: Implement a middleware that adds a custom header to every successful HTTP response. How would you ensure this header is not added if an exception occurs?**

**A:**
We can add the header **after `await _next(context)`**, so it only executes when no exception bubbles up.

**Code:**

```csharp
public class CustomHeaderMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public CustomHeaderMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        try
        {
            await _next(context);  // Process request

            if (context.Response.StatusCode < 400) // only for successful responses
            {
                context.Response.Headers.Add("X-App-Version", "1.0.0");
            }
        }
        catch
        {
            // Do not add the header if an exception occurs
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

**Register in Program.cs**

```csharp
app.UseMiddleware<CustomHeaderMiddleware>();
```

‚úÖ **Why:** The header is only added after downstream middleware succeeds. If an exception occurs, ASP.NET Core exception handling middleware will take over, and our header won‚Äôt be injected.

## **3. Q: You need to serve static files from a specific folder that is not the default `wwwroot` folder. Write the code to configure the StaticFiles middleware for this purpose and explain its position in the pipeline.**

**A:**
The `StaticFiles` middleware can be configured to serve files from any folder using `UseStaticFiles` with `StaticFileOptions`.

**Code:**

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Serve static files from "MyStaticFiles" folder at "/content" URL path
app.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions
{
    FileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider(
        Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "MyStaticFiles")),
    RequestPath = "/content"
});

app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

**Explanation:**

* If there is a file `MyStaticFiles/logo.png`, it will be accessible at:
  üëâ `https://localhost:5001/content/logo.png`
* **Position in pipeline is important:** Place `UseStaticFiles` **early** in the pipeline (before authentication/authorization middleware and MVC routing), so static assets are served quickly without unnecessary processing.

‚úÖ **Why:** Efficient handling of static content and better performance.

Would you like me to also prepare a **table of common built-in middleware (StaticFiles, Routing, Authentication, ExceptionHandler, etc.) with their typical pipeline order**? That could be a handy **interview cheat sheet**.
