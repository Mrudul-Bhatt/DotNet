Perfect ðŸ‘Œ â€” letâ€™s keep the same **Q â†’ A** format, with concise explanations and code examples targeted for a **3â€“5 yrs Software Engineer** interview.

---

## **1. Q: Why is the ConfigureServices method executed before the Configure method?**

**A:**

* The **`ConfigureServices`** method is executed first because it registers all the services required by the application in the **Dependency Injection (DI) container**.
* The **`Configure`** method then sets up the middleware pipeline, and middleware often depends on those registered services.
* Without registering services first, the middleware and controllers would not have access to the necessary dependencies.

**Example:**

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Registering dependencies before pipeline setup
        services.AddControllers();
        services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>();
        services.AddScoped<INotificationService, EmailNotificationService>();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        // Using registered services inside middleware
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }

        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseAuthorization();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
}
```

âœ… **Key Point:**
The **request pipeline (`Configure`) depends on services registered in `ConfigureServices`**, hence it must run second.

## **2. Q: What is the significance of the IWebHostEnvironment parameter often seen in the Configure method?**

**A:**

* The **`IWebHostEnvironment`** parameter provides information about the current hosting environment of the application (e.g., `Development`, `Staging`, `Production`).
* This allows developers to configure **environment-specific middleware** and behavior.
* Example: show detailed exception pages in development but generic error handling in production.

**Example:**

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        // Show detailed error info during development
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        // Generic error handling in Production
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
        app.UseHsts();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
```

âœ… **Key Point:**
`IWebHostEnvironment` helps make the application **environment-aware**, so you can adjust middleware and behavior for different deployment stages.

Would you like me to also include a **list of common environment-based configurations** (like logging, error handling, CORS, caching) that interviewers often expect as follow-up?
