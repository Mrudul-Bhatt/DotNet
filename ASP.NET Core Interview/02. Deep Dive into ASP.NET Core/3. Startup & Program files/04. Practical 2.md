Perfect ‚Äî here are structured **Q ‚Üí A** style answers with **code snippets** for a **3‚Äì5 yrs Software Engineer** level interview:

---

## **1. Q: How would you conditionally add a middleware (e.g., UseDeveloperExceptionPage()) to the request pipeline only when the application is running in a development environment?**

**A:**
ASP.NET Core provides **`IWebHostEnvironment`** (or **`app.Environment`** in .NET 6+) to check the current environment (Development, Staging, Production).
We can conditionally register middleware like `UseDeveloperExceptionPage()` only in Development.

**Code Example (Program.cs in .NET 6+):**

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Add middleware conditionally based on environment
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
}
else
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error"); // Generic error handling in Prod
}

app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

---

## **2. Q: You want to inject a configuration value from appsettings.json directly into a service. Show how you would achieve this using the IOptions pattern.**

**A:**
The **IOptions pattern** is used for binding strongly-typed configuration classes to values in **appsettings.json**.

**appsettings.json:**

```json
{
  "MySettings": {
    "ApiKey": "12345-ABCDE",
    "MaxItems": 10
  }
}
```

**Configuration Class:**

```csharp
public class MySettings
{
    public string ApiKey { get; set; }
    public int MaxItems { get; set; }
}
```

**Service that uses IOptions:**

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly MySettings _settings;

    public MyService(IOptions<MySettings> options)
    {
        _settings = options.Value;
    }

    public string GetApiKey() => _settings.ApiKey;
}
```

**Program.cs Registration:**

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Bind MySettings section
builder.Services.Configure<MySettings>(
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("MySettings"));

// Register service
builder.Services.AddScoped<MyService>();

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

---

## **3. Q: Explain the order of services being registered in ConfigureServices and how that might affect dependency injection. For example, what happens if a service is registered as a Singleton, but it depends on a Scoped service?**

**A:**

* Services are registered in `ConfigureServices` (or `builder.Services` in .NET 6+).
* The **lifetime mismatch** rule is important:

  * **Singleton** ‚Üí lives for the entire app lifetime.
  * **Scoped** ‚Üí lives for a single HTTP request.
  * **Transient** ‚Üí created every time.

üëâ If a **Singleton depends on a Scoped service**, the Scoped service instance will be **captured once** (when Singleton is created). That Scoped service won‚Äôt change per request, which can cause **incorrect behavior or data leaks across requests**.

**Example (Problematic):**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<MySingletonService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<MyScopedService>();
```

```csharp
public class MySingletonService
{
    private readonly MyScopedService _scoped;
    public MySingletonService(MyScopedService scoped)  // ‚ùå Scoped injected into Singleton
    {
        _scoped = scoped;
    }
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Result:** `MyScopedService` will behave like a Singleton inside `MySingletonService`.

**Best Practice:**

* Avoid injecting **Scoped** into **Singleton**.
* If necessary, inject `IServiceProvider` and create a scope manually.

## **4. Q: Describe a time when you had to debug an issue related to services or middleware in Startup.cs (or Program.cs). What was the problem, and how did you solve it?**

**A:** *(Example answer suitable for 3‚Äì5 yrs exp.)*

In one project, I faced an issue where **dependency injection was failing with an `InvalidOperationException`**. The error said:

> *‚ÄúCannot consume scoped service X from singleton service Y.‚Äù*

### **Problem:**

A Singleton service was depending on a DbContext (which is Scoped). This caused scope mismatch.

### **Steps I Took to Debug:**

1. Checked **service lifetimes** in `ConfigureServices` and noticed DbContext was registered as Scoped.
2. The Singleton service constructor was directly depending on DbContext.
3. Realized this was the classic Scoped-into-Singleton issue.

### **Solution:**

* Changed the Singleton service to Scoped because it naturally depended on request-level data.
* Alternatively, could have used `IServiceScopeFactory` to resolve Scoped dependencies correctly.

**Fixed Code:**

```csharp
// ‚ùå Wrong
builder.Services.AddSingleton<MyReportGenerator>();

// ‚úÖ Fixed
builder.Services.AddScoped<MyReportGenerator>();
```

After the fix, DI worked correctly and the application stopped throwing runtime errors.

‚úÖ These answers cover **conditional middleware, IOptions pattern, DI lifetime issues, and real debugging experience** ‚Äî all typical interview expectations for a **mid-level ASP.NET Core developer**.

Do you want me to also create a **visual diagram (pipeline + DI lifetimes)** to quickly explain these concepts in interviews? That can really impress interviewers.
