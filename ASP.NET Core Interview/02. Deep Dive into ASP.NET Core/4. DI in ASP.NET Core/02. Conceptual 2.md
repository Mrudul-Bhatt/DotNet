Perfect üëç Here are **interview-style Q\&A answers (with code, scenarios, and reasoning)** for a **3‚Äì5 yrs Software Engineer**:

---

## **1. Q: Explain the concept of service registration and service resolution. How does the DI container handle a request to inject a service at runtime?**

**A:**

* **Service Registration** ‚Üí You register types and their lifetimes with the DI container (usually in `ConfigureServices` or `Program.cs`).

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddScoped<IOrderService, OrderService>();
  builder.Services.AddSingleton<ILoggingService, LoggingService>();
  ```
* **Service Resolution** ‚Üí At runtime, when a class (e.g., a controller) needs a dependency, the DI container looks up the registered service and creates/provides an instance.

  ```csharp
  public class OrdersController : ControllerBase
  {
      private readonly IOrderService _orderService;
      
      public OrdersController(IOrderService orderService) // resolved here
      {
          _orderService = orderService;
      }
  }
  ```
* **How DI Container Works:**

  1. Checks the registration dictionary.
  2. Determines lifetime (Singleton/Scoped/Transient).
  3. Creates the object if not already available (for Singleton/Scoped).
  4. Injects it into the constructor/property/method.

üëâ This is how dependencies are **decoupled** from object creation.

---

## **2. Q: What is the difference between injecting a service directly and injecting an IServiceProvider? When would you use the latter, and what are the potential downsides of doing so?**

**A:**

* **Injecting a service directly (Recommended):**

  ```csharp
  public class ReportGenerator
  {
      private readonly ILogger _logger;
      public ReportGenerator(ILogger logger)   // preferred
      {
          _logger = logger;
      }
  }
  ```

  * Clear dependencies, compiler-checked, easier to unit test.

* **Injecting IServiceProvider (Service Locator pattern):**

  ```csharp
  public class ReportGenerator
  {
      private readonly IServiceProvider _provider;
      public ReportGenerator(IServiceProvider provider)
      {
          _provider = provider;
      }

      public void Generate()
      {
          var logger = _provider.GetService<ILogger>(); // resolved manually
      }
  }
  ```

  * **When to use:**

    * Resolving services dynamically at runtime (e.g., plugin system, optional services).
    * Avoiding circular dependencies.
  * **Downsides:**

    * Hides actual dependencies (harder to test & maintain).
    * Violates **Explicit Dependencies Principle**.
    * Can become a **Service Locator anti-pattern** if overused.

üëâ Use `IServiceProvider` **rarely** and only when absolutely necessary.

---

## **3. Q: Can you describe a scenario where a Scoped service is a critical design choice?**

**A:**

* **Scenario: Entity Framework `DbContext`**

  * A `DbContext` represents a **unit of work per request**.
  * If it were `Transient`, multiple contexts in one request could cause inconsistencies.
  * If it were `Singleton`, data from different users/requests could leak across sessions ‚Üí **security bug**.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<AppDbContext>(); // Correct lifetime

public class OrderService : IOrderService
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _db;
    public OrderService(AppDbContext db)
    {
        _db = db; // one shared per request
    }
}
```

üëâ Scoped ensures **transaction integrity** and **data isolation per request**.

---

## **4. Q: How does DI in ASP.NET Core help in unit testing? What is the role of mocking frameworks in this process?**

**A:**

* **How DI helps in Unit Testing:**

  * Since services depend on **abstractions (interfaces)**, we can replace real implementations with mocks/fakes in tests.
  * No need to spin up real DB, APIs, or services during tests.

**Code Example (xUnit + Moq):**

```csharp
public interface IEmailService
{
    void SendEmail(string to, string message);
}

public class NotificationService
{
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;
    public NotificationService(IEmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public void Notify(string user) => _emailService.SendEmail(user, "Welcome!");
}
```

**Unit Test:**

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Notify_Should_Call_EmailService()
{
    var mockEmailService = new Mock<IEmailService>();
    var notificationService = new NotificationService(mockEmailService.Object);

    notificationService.Notify("test@xyz.com");

    mockEmailService.Verify(e => e.SendEmail("test@xyz.com", "Welcome!"), Times.Once);
}
```

* **Role of Mocking Frameworks (e.g., Moq, NSubstitute):**

  * Quickly create fake implementations.
  * Verify interactions (`Verify` in Moq).
  * Simulate exceptions or return values.

üëâ DI enables **easy substitution of dependencies**, and mocking frameworks make unit tests **faster, isolated, and reliable**.
