Got it üëç ‚Äî here are the structured **Q ‚Üí A** style answers with examples, real-world analogies, and risks explained, tailored for a **3‚Äì5 yrs Software Engineer** interview:

---

## **1. Q: What is the built-in DI container in ASP.NET Core? Why did Microsoft choose to include one, rather than requiring a third-party container like Autofac or Ninject?**

**A:**

* The built-in DI container in ASP.NET Core is a **lightweight, extensible IoC (Inversion of Control) container** that supports **constructor injection**, **lifetime management**, and **generic types**.
* Microsoft included it because:

  1. **Consistency** ‚Üí Developers don‚Äôt need to depend on 3rd party libraries to use DI.
  2. **Simplicity** ‚Üí Covers 90% of typical DI needs without extra configuration.
  3. **Performance** ‚Üí Built-in container is optimized for ASP.NET Core.
  4. **Extensibility** ‚Üí If advanced features are needed, developers can still integrate Autofac, Ninject, etc.

**Code Example:**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();  // Uses built-in DI
```

üëâ This provides a **standard baseline** while allowing advanced users to plug in third-party containers.

## **2. Q: Explain the three main service lifetimes in ASP.NET Core: Singleton, Scoped, and Transient. Provide a simple, real-world analogy for each to illustrate its behavior.**

**A:**

* **Singleton** ‚Üí One instance for the entire application lifetime.

  * *Analogy:* Like a **company CEO** ‚Äî only one person, shared by everyone.
  * Example: Logging service.

* **Scoped** ‚Üí One instance per HTTP request (shared within that request).

  * *Analogy:* Like a **waiter assigned to your table** in a restaurant ‚Äî one per table/request.
  * Example: DbContext (to ensure one context per request).

* **Transient** ‚Üí New instance created every time it‚Äôs requested.

  * *Analogy:* Like a **disposable coffee cup** ‚Äî a fresh one for every use.
  * Example: Calculation helpers, lightweight services.

## **3. Q: What are the key differences between AddSingleton, AddScoped, and AddTransient?**

**A:**

| Method         | Lifetime                          | Behavior                                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `AddSingleton` | Single instance across entire app | Same instance for all requests & users          |
| `AddScoped`    | One instance per HTTP request     | Shared within request, but new for each request |
| `AddTransient` | New instance every time requested | Always fresh instance                           |

**Code Example:**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<ILogService, LogService>();   // Global logger
builder.Services.AddScoped<IOrderService, OrderService>(); // Per-request service
builder.Services.AddTransient<IEmailService, EmailService>(); // New every time
```

## **4. Q: When would you choose a Singleton lifetime for a service? What are the potential risks or issues associated with using a singleton, particularly in a multithreaded environment?**

**A:**

* **Use Singleton when:**

  * The service is **stateless**.
  * The service is **expensive to create** (e.g., caching provider, configuration manager).
  * It holds **global application state** (e.g., logging, feature flag manager).

* **Potential Risks / Issues:**

  1. **Thread Safety** ‚Üí Since a Singleton is shared across threads/requests, if it modifies state, race conditions may occur.

     * *Fix:* Ensure code is **thread-safe** using locks, `ConcurrentDictionary`, or immutability.
  2. **Memory Leaks** ‚Üí Singleton lives until the app stops, so any memory it holds is never released.
  3. **Scoped Dependency Issue** ‚Üí If a Singleton depends on a Scoped service, it will capture one instance forever, breaking the Scoped semantics.

**Bad Example (Scoped inside Singleton):**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<MySingleton>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<MyDbContext>(); // ‚ùå risky inside Singleton
```

**Good Example (Thread-safe Singleton):**

```csharp
public class ConfigCache
{
    private readonly object _lock = new();
    private Dictionary<string, string> _cache = new();

    public void Add(string key, string value)
    {
        lock (_lock) // Ensure thread safety
        {
            _cache[key] = value;
        }
    }
}
```

‚úÖ These answers combine **theory + code + analogies + risks**, which is exactly what interviewers expect from a **mid-level engineer (3‚Äì5 yrs)**.

Would you like me to also prepare a **diagram (Service Lifetime + Pipeline Interaction)** that you can sketch in an interview whiteboard round?
