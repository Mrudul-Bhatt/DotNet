## How Do You Handle Timeouts and Cancellations with `CancellationToken`?

In modern asynchronous C\# programming, `CancellationToken` is the standard and most robust mechanism for cooperative cancellation of long-running operations. It's incredibly versatile and can be used for both explicit user-initiated cancellations and implicit timeouts.

### The Core Components: `CancellationTokenSource` and `CancellationToken`

1.  **`CancellationTokenSource`**:

      * This is the object that **initiates** and **manages** the cancellation.
      * You create an instance of `CancellationTokenSource` to signal cancellation.
      * It has a `Cancel()` method that sets its associated `CancellationToken` to a canceled state.
      * It also provides a `Token` property, which returns the `CancellationToken` that you pass around to your cancellable operations.
      * It implements `IDisposable`, and it's crucial to `Dispose()` it when you're done to release resources.

2.  **`CancellationToken`**:

      * This is the object that **observes** the cancellation request.
      * It's a lightweight struct (making it efficient to pass by value).
      * It has an `IsCancellationRequested` property that returns `true` if cancellation has been requested.
      * It has a `ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` method, which throws an `OperationCanceledException` if cancellation has been requested. This is a common and convenient way to exit early from an operation.
      * It can be linked to other `CancellationToken` instances using `CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource()`.

### How Cooperative Cancellation Works

The key term here is **"cooperative."** `CancellationToken` does not *force* an operation to stop. Instead, it acts as a signal. The long-running operation must *periodically check* the `CancellationToken`'s state and decide to stop gracefully if cancellation is requested.

**General Steps for Implementing Cancellable Operations:**

1.  **Create `CancellationTokenSource`**: In the "caller" code (the one initiating the cancellable operation), create an instance of `CancellationTokenSource`.
2.  **Get `CancellationToken`**: Obtain the `CancellationToken` from the `CancellationTokenSource.Token` property.
3.  **Pass `CancellationToken`**: Pass this `CancellationToken` down to the method(s) that perform the long-running work.
4.  **Check `CancellationToken`**: Inside the long-running method, periodically check `token.IsCancellationRequested` or call `token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()`.
5.  **Initiate Cancellation**: When cancellation is desired, call `source.Cancel()`.
6.  **Handle `OperationCanceledException`**: The calling code (and potentially intermediate methods) should be prepared to catch `OperationCanceledException` to gracefully handle the cancellation.

### Handling Timeouts with `CancellationToken`

`CancellationTokenSource` has a constructor that accepts a `TimeSpan` or an `int` milliseconds, which allows it to automatically cancel the token after a specified duration. This is an elegant way to implement timeouts.

**Steps for Implementing Timeouts:**

1.  **Create `CancellationTokenSource` with Timeout**: `using var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));`
2.  **Pass Token**: Pass `cts.Token` to your cancellable operation.
3.  **Handle Cancellation**: The cancellable operation checks the token as usual. If it times out, `token.IsCancellationRequested` will become `true`, and `token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` will throw.

### Code Examples

Let's illustrate with various scenarios.

#### Example 1: Basic User-Initiated Cancellation

This example shows a long-running process that can be cancelled by a user pressing a key.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class BasicCancellation
{
    public static async Task RunDemo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Basic User-Initiated Cancellation Demo ---");
        Console.WriteLine("Starting a long operation. Press 'C' to cancel.");

        using var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
        CancellationToken token = cts.Token;

        // Start the cancellable operation in a separate task
        Task longRunningTask = PerformLongOperation(token);

        // Monitor for user input to cancel
        Task inputTask = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            while (Console.ReadKey(true).Key != ConsoleKey.C && !token.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                // Keep waiting for 'C' or for cancellation already initiated
            }
            if (!token.IsCancellationRequested) // Only call Cancel if not already cancelled
            {
                Console.WriteLine("\n'C' pressed. Requesting cancellation...");
                cts.Cancel();
            }
        });

        try
        {
            await Task.WhenAny(longRunningTask, inputTask); // Wait for either task to complete or input
            await longRunningTask; // Await the long-running task to propagate any exceptions
            Console.WriteLine("\nLong operation finished or was cancelled gracefully.");
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
            Console.WriteLine("\nLong operation was cancelled!");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
            Console.WriteLine($"\nLong operation failed with error: {ex.Message}");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }
        
        // Ensure inputTask is also completed before exiting
        // If longRunningTask finished normally, inputTask might still be waiting for input
        if (!inputTask.IsCompleted)
        {
            cts.Cancel(); // Ensure input task also finishes
            await inputTask;
        }

        Console.WriteLine("--- Basic Cancellation Demo Finished ---");
    }

    private static async Task PerformLongOperation(CancellationToken token)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            // Check for cancellation at the start of each iteration
            // This is the most common and robust way
            token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); 

            Console.WriteLine($"  Working... Step {i + 1}/10 (Thread: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId})");
            
            await Task.Delay(500, token); // Task.Delay also accepts CancellationToken!
                                          // If cancelled, it will throw OperationCanceledException
                                          // and not complete the delay.
        }
        Console.WriteLine("  Long operation completed all steps.");
    }
}
```

**Output (`BasicCancellation`):**

```
--- Basic User-Initiated Cancellation Demo ---
Starting a long operation. Press 'C' to cancel.
  Working... Step 1/10 (Thread: 3)
  Working... Step 2/10 (Thread: 3)
'C' pressed. Requesting cancellation...
  Working... Step 3/10 (Thread: 3) // This might print before the exception propagates
Long operation was cancelled!
--- Basic Cancellation Demo Finished ---
```

If you don't press 'C', the operation will complete normally after 5 seconds. If you press 'C', the `OperationCanceledException` will be thrown, caught, and handled. Notice how `Task.Delay` itself is cancellation-aware.

#### Example 2: Timeouts using `CancellationTokenSource`

This example demonstrates how to set a timeout for an operation.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class TimeoutCancellation
{
    public static async Task RunDemo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Timeout Cancellation Demo ---");

        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 1: Operation times out (500ms timeout)");
        await RunOperationWithTimeout(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));

        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 2: Operation completes within timeout (2000ms timeout)");
        await RunOperationWithTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2), TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500));

        Console.WriteLine("--- Timeout Cancellation Demo Finished ---");
    }

    private static async Task RunOperationWithTimeout(TimeSpan timeout, TimeSpan simulatedWorkTime)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Attempting operation with timeout of {timeout.TotalMilliseconds}ms and simulated work of {simulatedWorkTime.TotalMilliseconds}ms.");

        using var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(timeout); // CancellationTokenSource with a timeout
        CancellationToken token = cts.Token;

        try
        {
            await PerformWorkAsync(simulatedWorkTime, token);
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
            Console.WriteLine($"Operation completed successfully within {timeout.TotalMilliseconds}ms!");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            // This exception specifically indicates a cancellation
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
            Console.WriteLine($"Operation was cancelled due to timeout after {timeout.TotalMilliseconds}ms!");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // For any other unexpected errors
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
            Console.WriteLine($"Operation failed unexpectedly: {ex.Message}");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }
    }

    private static async Task PerformWorkAsync(TimeSpan duration, CancellationToken token)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"  [Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Starting work for {duration.TotalMilliseconds}ms...");
        try
        {
            await Task.Delay(duration, token); // Pass the token to Task.Delay
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Work simulation completed.");
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            // Important: Catch and rethrow if you just want to pass the cancellation up,
            // or handle it if you want to perform cleanup and suppress the rethrow.
            // In this case, we just want to rethrow to the caller.
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Work simulation was cancelled.");
            throw; // Rethrow to propagate the cancellation
        }
    }
}
```

**Output (`TimeoutCancellation`):**

```
--- Timeout Cancellation Demo ---

Scenario 1: Operation times out (500ms timeout)
Attempting operation with timeout of 500ms and simulated work of 2000ms.
  [Thread 3] Starting work for 2000ms...
  [Thread 3] Work simulation was cancelled.
Operation was cancelled due to timeout after 500ms!

Scenario 2: Operation completes within timeout (2000ms timeout)
Attempting operation with timeout of 2000ms and simulated work of 500ms.
  [Thread 3] Starting work for 500ms...
  [Thread 3] Work simulation completed.
Operation completed successfully within 2000ms!

--- Timeout Cancellation Demo Finished ---
```

This shows how `CancellationTokenSource` handles the timeout automatically, triggering cancellation when the time is up.

#### Example 3: Linking Tokens

You can link multiple `CancellationToken` instances. This is useful when you have a global application cancellation token, but also a specific operation-level timeout. If either is cancelled, the linked token will be cancelled.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class LinkedTokens
{
    public static async Task RunDemo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Linked Tokens Demo ---");

        using var globalCts = new CancellationTokenSource(); // Global application cancellation
        
        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 1: Global cancellation (5s delay, 2s global cancel)");
        // Start a task to cancel globally after 2 seconds
        _ = Task.Run(async () => {
            await Task.Delay(2000);
            Console.WriteLine("Global CTS triggering cancel...");
            globalCts.Cancel();
        });
        await RunOperationWithLinkedToken(globalCts.Token, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

        Console.WriteLine("\nScenario 2: Operation-specific timeout (5s delay, 1s timeout)");
        // Reset global CTS if it was cancelled
        using var globalCts2 = new CancellationTokenSource();
        await RunOperationWithLinkedToken(globalCts2.Token, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)); // Shorter timeout

        Console.WriteLine("--- Linked Tokens Demo Finished ---");
    }

    private static async Task RunOperationWithLinkedToken(CancellationToken parentToken, TimeSpan operationTimeout)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Operation with parent token and {operationTimeout.TotalMilliseconds}ms timeout starting.");
        
        // Create a linked token source that cancels if parentToken cancels OR after operationTimeout
        using var linkedCts = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(parentToken);
        linkedCts.CancelAfter(operationTimeout); // Add the specific operation timeout

        CancellationToken linkedToken = linkedCts.Token;

        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Performing work...");
            // Simulate work that takes 3 seconds
            await Task.Delay(3000, linkedToken); 
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
            Console.WriteLine("Operation completed.");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
            if (parentToken.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Operation cancelled by parent/global token.");
            }
            else if (linkedToken.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Operation cancelled by its specific timeout.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Operation cancelled for unknown reason.");
            }
            Console.ResetColor();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
            Console.WriteLine($"Operation failed: {ex.Message}");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output (`LinkedTokens`):**

```
--- Linked Tokens Demo ---

Scenario 1: Global cancellation (5s delay, 2s global cancel)
Operation with parent token and 5000ms timeout starting.
  [Thread 3] Performing work...
Global CTS triggering cancel...
Operation cancelled by parent/global token.

Scenario 2: Operation-specific timeout (5s delay, 1s timeout)
Operation with parent token and 1000ms timeout starting.
  [Thread 3] Performing work...
Operation cancelled by its specific timeout.

--- Linked Tokens Demo Finished ---
```

This shows the power of linking tokens. The operation respects both the global cancellation signal and its own specific timeout.

### Important Considerations:

  * **Cooperative Nature:** Remember, `CancellationToken` only *signals* a request. Your code *must* actively check the token to respond to the request. If your long-running operation is entirely CPU-bound and doesn't check the token, it will run to completion regardless of cancellation requests.
  * **External Libraries:** Many .NET built-in async methods (e.g., `HttpClient.GetAsync`, `Stream.CopyToAsync`, `Task.Delay`) accept a `CancellationToken` parameter. Always pass it if available. For third-party libraries, check their documentation to see if they support cancellation.
  * **Cleanup:** If your operation acquires resources (file handles, network connections), ensure they are properly released when a cancellation occurs, often within a `finally` block or by structuring your code to clean up immediately after `ThrowIfCancellationRequested()`.
  * **`OperationCanceledException`:** This specific exception is thrown by `ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` and by cancellation-aware async methods. It's designed to indicate a cooperative cancellation, not an error. Catch it specifically when you need to distinguish cancellation from other failures.
  * **Resource Management:** `CancellationTokenSource` implements `IDisposable`. Always wrap its creation in a `using` statement or manually call `Dispose()` to release resources.
  * **Avoiding Redundant `await`s:** When you `await Task.Delay(..., token)`, if the token is canceled, `Task.Delay` will throw `OperationCanceledException`. You generally don't need `token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` immediately *after* such an `await` within the same method, as the `await` itself will handle it. However, if there's other code after that `await` that you don't want to run on cancellation, a subsequent check or `try-catch` might be appropriate.

By correctly implementing `CancellationToken` throughout your asynchronous code, you enable robust, responsive applications that can gracefully handle user cancellations, system shutdowns, and time limits.
