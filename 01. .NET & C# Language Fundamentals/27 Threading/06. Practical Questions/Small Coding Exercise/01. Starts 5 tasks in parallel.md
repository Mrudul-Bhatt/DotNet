Let's dive deeply into writing a method that starts 5 tasks in parallel, each doing some work and returning a result, and then combining those results at the end. We'll cover different approaches, best practices, and potential considerations.

-----

## Starting Parallel Tasks, Getting Results, and Combining Them

This is a very common pattern in asynchronous and parallel programming: distribute a workload, wait for all parts to complete, and then aggregate their individual results. .NET's Task Parallel Library (TPL) with `async`/`await` makes this straightforward and efficient.

### The Core Concept: `Task.WhenAll`

The `Task.WhenAll` method is the cornerstone for this scenario. It takes a collection of `Task` objects (or `Task<TResult>` objects) and returns a single `Task` that completes when *all* of the input tasks have completed.

  * If `Task.WhenAll` is given `Task<TResult>` objects, its resulting `Task` will be a `Task<TResult[]>` (an array of the results).
  * If any of the input tasks fault, the `Task.WhenAll` task will also fault (and its `AggregateException` will contain all the exceptions from the faulted tasks).
  * If any of the input tasks are canceled, `Task.WhenAll` will also be canceled.

### Method Design: `RunParallelTasksAndCombineResults`

Let's design a method that encapsulates this logic.

**Requirements:**

1.  Start 5 parallel tasks.
2.  Each task performs some "work" (simulated here as a delay and a simple calculation).
3.  Each task returns a `string` result.
4.  Combine these `string` results into a single aggregated result (e.g., a comma-separated string, or a list).

-----

### **Approach 1: Using `Task.WhenAll` and `async`/`await` (Recommended)**

This is the most idiomatic and efficient way in modern .NET. It leverages the Thread Pool and asynchronous I/O (if your "work" were I/O-bound) effectively, without blocking threads unnecessarily.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Threading; // For Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId

public class ParallelTaskCombiner
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Represents the work each parallel task will perform.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="taskId">A unique identifier for the task.</param>
    /// <returns>A Task representing the asynchronous work, yielding a string result.</returns>
    private static async Task<string> PerformWorkAsync(int taskId)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskId} started on Thread ID: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");

        // Simulate some asynchronous I/O-bound work (e.g., fetching data from a web service, database query)
        // Task.Delay does not block the current thread.
        int delayMs = new Random().Next(500, 2000); // Random delay between 0.5 and 2 seconds
        await Task.Delay(delayMs); 

        // Simulate some CPU-bound calculation (brief)
        int resultValue = taskId * 100 + delayMs / 10;

        Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskId} finished on Thread ID: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId} (delayed {delayMs}ms)");
        return $"Result from Task {taskId}: Value = {resultValue}";
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Starts multiple tasks in parallel, awaits their completion, and combines their results.
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns>A single string containing combined results, or an error message if tasks fail.</returns>
    public static async Task<string> RunParallelTasksAndCombineResultsAsync()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Starting Parallel Tasks Demo (Async/Await) ---");
        Console.WriteLine($"Main method caller Thread ID: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");

        // 1. Create a list to hold the Tasks
        List<Task<string>> tasks = new List<Task<string>>();

        // 2. Start 5 parallel tasks
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
        {
            // Task.Run is used here to ensure the work (even if it's async) starts on a Thread Pool thread.
            // If PerformWorkAsync was purely CPU-bound, Task.Run would be essential.
            // Since PerformWorkAsync has an await (Task.Delay), it will yield the thread back.
            tasks.Add(PerformWorkAsync(i)); 
        }

        string combinedResults;
        try
        {
            // 3. Wait for all tasks to complete asynchronously
            // This does NOT block the current thread. It returns control to the caller.
            string[] results = await Task.WhenAll(tasks);

            // 4. Combine the results
            combinedResults = string.Join("\n", results);
            Console.WriteLine("\n--- All Parallel Tasks Completed Successfully ---");
            Console.WriteLine("Combined Results:");
            Console.WriteLine(combinedResults);
        }
        catch (AggregateException ae)
        {
            // Task.WhenAll will wrap all exceptions in an AggregateException
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
            Console.WriteLine("\n!!! One or more tasks failed !!!");
            foreach (var ex in ae.Flatten().InnerExceptions)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
            }
            Console.ResetColor();
            combinedResults = "Error: Some tasks failed. Check logs for details.";
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Catch any other unexpected exceptions
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
            Console.WriteLine($"\nAn unexpected error occurred: {ex.Message}");
            Console.ResetColor();
            combinedResults = "Error: An unexpected error occurred.";
        }

        return combinedResults;
    }

    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        string finalCombinedResult = await RunParallelTasksAndCombineResultsAsync();
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Final Combined Result from Main: ---");
        Console.WriteLine(finalCombinedResult);

        // Demonstrate a scenario where a task might fail
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Demo with a Failing Task ---");
        List<Task<string>> failingTasks = new List<Task<string>>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
        {
            int taskId = i;
            failingTasks.Add(Task.Run(async () =>
            {
                if (taskId == 2)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskId} (failing) starting on Thread ID: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
                    await Task.Delay(100);
                    throw new InvalidOperationException($"Task {taskId} intentionally failed!");
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskId} starting on Thread ID: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
                    await Task.Delay(50);
                    return $"Result from Task {taskId} (successful)";
                }
            }));
        }

        try
        {
            string[] results = await Task.WhenAll(failingTasks);
            Console.WriteLine("All tasks completed, results: " + string.Join(", ", results));
        }
        catch (AggregateException ae)
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
            Console.WriteLine("\nCaught AggregateException for failing tasks:");
            foreach (var ex in ae.Flatten().InnerExceptions)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"- {ex.Message}");
            }
            Console.ResetColor();
        }

        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`PerformWorkAsync(int taskId)`:**

      * This is an `async Task<string>` method, indicating it will perform asynchronous work and eventually return a `string`.
      * `await Task.Delay(delayMs);` is crucial. It simulates an I/O-bound operation (like a network call or database query). When `Task.Delay` is awaited, the thread that called it is *released back to the Thread Pool* to do other work. The `PerformWorkAsync` method itself remains in a `WaitingForCompletion` state. Once the delay is over, its continuation (the code after `await Task.Delay`) is scheduled on an *available* Thread Pool thread. This is the essence of non-blocking asynchronous programming.
      * The `Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId` logging helps observe that tasks might start on one thread, yield, and resume on a different thread, or even the same thread if it becomes available quickly.

2.  **`RunParallelTasksAndCombineResultsAsync()`:**

      * **`List<Task<string>> tasks = new List<Task<string>>();`**: We collect the `Task` objects returned by `PerformWorkAsync`.
      * **`tasks.Add(PerformWorkAsync(i));`**: Calling an `async` method *starts* its execution. It returns a `Task` that represents the ongoing work. We add these `Task` instances to our list.
      * **`string[] results = await Task.WhenAll(tasks);`**: This is the magic.
          * `Task.WhenAll(tasks)` returns a single `Task<string[]>` that will complete only when *all* tasks in the `tasks` list have completed (either successfully, with an exception, or cancelled).
          * `await` on `Task.WhenAll` means the `RunParallelTasksAndCombineResultsAsync` method itself yields control back to its caller. The thread that was executing `RunParallelTasksAndCombineResultsAsync` is *released*.
          * When *all* child tasks complete, the `await Task.WhenAll` expression completes, and the `string[] results` array is populated with the individual string results from each `Task<string>`. The continuation of `RunParallelTasksAndCombineResultsAsync` is then scheduled back on an available Thread Pool thread.
      * **Error Handling (`try-catch AggregateException`):** It's vital to handle `AggregateException` when `await`ing `Task.WhenAll`. If *any* of the awaited tasks throws an exception, `Task.WhenAll` will wrap all exceptions (even if multiple tasks failed) into an `AggregateException`. You should flatten this and iterate `InnerExceptions` to see all failures.

### **Approach 2: Using `Parallel.ForEach` (for CPU-Bound Parallelism)**

While `Task.WhenAll` is for *asynchronous* concurrency (often I/O-bound), `Parallel.ForEach` (part of `System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel`) is designed for *CPU-bound* parallelism, typically used when you have a collection of independent items to process and want to use multiple CPU cores. It's synchronous from the caller's perspective, meaning the calling thread *blocks* until all iterations complete.

If your "work" was purely CPU-bound and didn't involve `await`ing I/O, `Parallel.ForEach` could be an alternative, though it returns no direct results from the iterations themselves without manual collection.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Collections.Concurrent; // For thread-safe collection

public class ParallelForEachCombiner
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Represents CPU-bound work each parallel iteration will perform.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="item">The input item for this iteration.</param>
    /// <returns>A string result.</returns>
    private static string PerformCpuWork(int item)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing item {item} on Thread ID: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
        
        // Simulate intense CPU work (blocking)
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++)
        {
            sum += i;
        }

        return $"Result from Item {item}: Sum = {sum}";
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Uses Parallel.ForEach to process items and collect results.
    /// </summary>
    public static string RunParallelForEachAndCombineResults()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Starting Parallel.ForEach Demo (CPU-Bound) ---");
        Console.WriteLine($"Main method caller Thread ID: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");

        var inputs = Enumerable.Range(1, 5).ToList(); // Our 5 items (1 to 5)
        
        // Use a thread-safe collection to store results from parallel operations
        var concurrentResults = new ConcurrentBag<string>();

        Parallel.ForEach(inputs, item =>
        {
            string result = PerformCpuWork(item);
            concurrentResults.Add(result);
        });

        string combinedResults = string.Join("\n", concurrentResults.OrderBy(s => s)); // Order for consistent output
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- All Parallel.ForEach Tasks Completed ---");
        Console.WriteLine("Combined Results:");
        Console.WriteLine(combinedResults);
        
        return combinedResults;
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // This is a synchronous call, Main will block until Parallel.ForEach completes
        string finalCombinedResult = RunParallelForEachAndCombineResults(); 
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Final Combined Result from Main: ---");
        Console.WriteLine(finalCombinedResult);
        
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
```

**Explanation for `Parallel.ForEach`:**

  * **`PerformCpuWork(int item)`:** This is a synchronous method that simulates blocking CPU-intensive work. It doesn't use `async`/`await`.
  * **`ConcurrentBag<string> concurrentResults`:** Since multiple threads will be adding results concurrently, we *must* use a thread-safe collection like `ConcurrentBag<T>` to avoid race conditions.
  * **`Parallel.ForEach(inputs, item => { ... });`**: This method orchestrates the execution of the loop iterations across multiple Thread Pool threads. The calling thread (`Main` in this case) will **block** until all iterations are complete.
  * **Suitability:** `Parallel.ForEach` is excellent for processing large collections of data where each item's processing is independent and primarily CPU-bound. If your "work" involved `await` (I/O-bound operations), you would combine `Task.WhenAll` with `Parallel.ForEach`'s ability to schedule tasks, but that becomes more complex. Generally, for I/O-bound parallelism, `Task.WhenAll` is simpler and more direct.

-----

### Key Takeaways and Best Practices:

  * **`async`/`await` and `Task.WhenAll` is the preferred approach for parallelizing I/O-bound operations.** It maximizes thread utilization by releasing threads back to the Thread Pool while waiting for I/O.
  * **`Parallel.ForEach` is primarily for CPU-bound operations.** The calling thread blocks until all work is done.
  * **Error Handling:** Always use `try-catch` blocks, especially around `await Task.WhenAll`, to handle `AggregateException` gracefully.
  * **Thread Safety for Shared State:** If your parallel tasks need to write to a shared data structure, ensure that data structure is thread-safe (e.g., `ConcurrentBag`, `ConcurrentDictionary`, or custom locking). In the `Task.WhenAll` example, the results are collected and combined *after* all tasks complete, so the `results` array is populated sequentially by the `Task.WhenAll` mechanism, which is safe.
  * **Task vs. Thread:** Remember that a `Task` is a unit of work, not necessarily a new thread. The TPL intelligently uses the Thread Pool. `await` releases the thread, while `Task.Run` might acquire a new one. `Parallel.ForEach` uses multiple Thread Pool threads concurrently.
  * **Cancellation:** For long-running parallel operations, always pass and respect `CancellationToken`s. `Task.WhenAll` will get canceled if any of its constituent tasks are canceled.
