It's Saturday, June 21, 2025 at 10:44:03 AM IST in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India. Let's delve deeply into `Task.WhenAll` and `Task.WhenAny`, two powerful methods in the C\# Task Parallel Library (TPL) that enable efficient coordination of multiple asynchronous operations. We'll explore their functionality, use cases, and provide detailed code examples.

-----

## `Task.WhenAll` and `Task.WhenAny`: Orchestrating Multiple Asynchronous Operations

In many applications, you'll encounter scenarios where you need to initiate several independent asynchronous operations and then either wait for all of them to complete or react as soon as any one of them finishes. `Task.WhenAll` and `Task.WhenAny` are specifically designed for these coordination patterns, allowing you to write more efficient, responsive, and robust asynchronous code.

Both methods return a new `Task` (or `Task<TResult>`) that represents the combined state of the input tasks. This new task can then be `await`ed, allowing you to non-blockingly wait for the desired outcome.

### 1\. `Task.WhenAll` (Wait for All Tasks to Complete)

`Task.WhenAll` creates a task that completes when **all** of the supplied tasks have completed. This means it waits for all tasks to either run to completion, fault, or be canceled.

**Signatures (Common Overloads):**

```csharp
public static Task WhenAll(params Task[] tasks);
public static Task<TResult[]> WhenAll<TResult>(params Task<TResult>[] tasks);
public static Task WhenAll(IEnumerable<Task> tasks);
public static Task<TResult[]> WhenAll<TResult>(IEnumerable<Task<TResult>> tasks);
```

**How it works:**

  * **Completion:** The `Task` returned by `WhenAll` completes when *all* the input tasks are in a final state (`RanToCompletion`, `Faulted`, or `Canceled`).
  * **Results:** If `WhenAll` is called with `Task<TResult>` instances, the returned `Task<TResult[]>` will hold an array of results, with each element corresponding to the result of the respective input task, in the same order.
  * **Exception Handling:** This is a crucial aspect. If *any* of the input tasks fault, the `Task` returned by `WhenAll` will also fault. Critically, if multiple tasks fault, `WhenAll` aggregates *all* the exceptions into a single `AggregateException`. When you `await` the `WhenAll` task, the first exception in that `AggregateException` is re-thrown (and if you want to handle all of them, you need to catch the `AggregateException` and iterate through its `InnerExceptions` property).
  * **Cancellation:** If any of the input tasks are canceled, the `WhenAll` task will also transition to a canceled state, *unless* there are also faulted tasks, in which case it will fault. Faults take precedence over cancellations.

**When to use `Task.WhenAll`:**

  * **Parallel execution of independent operations:** When you need to perform several operations concurrently and then process their results together (e.g., fetching data from multiple APIs, processing several files simultaneously).
  * **Waiting for a group of background tasks:** To ensure all parts of a complex operation are finished before proceeding.
  * **Aggregating results:** When you need a collection of results from multiple, same-typed asynchronous operations.

--- Task.WhenAll Demonstration Finished ---
```

Notice how in Scenario 1, the total time is approximately the duration of the *longest* task (2500ms). In Scenario 2, even though `ServiceE` failed, `ServiceD` and `ServiceF` still ran to completion before `WhenAll` faulted. In Scenario 3, `AggregateException` correctly contains all the individual task exceptions.

### 2\. `Task.WhenAny` (Wait for Any Task to Complete)

`Task.WhenAny` creates a task that completes when **any one** of the supplied tasks has completed. This means it completes as soon as any task either runs to completion, faults, or is canceled.

**Signatures (Common Overloads):**

```csharp
public static Task<Task> WhenAny(params Task[] tasks);
public static Task<Task<TResult>> WhenAny<TResult>(params Task<TResult>[] tasks);
public static Task<Task> WhenAny(IEnumerable<Task> tasks);
public static Task<Task<TResult>> WhenAny<TResult>(IEnumerable<Task<TResult>> tasks);
```

**How it works:**

  * **Completion:** The `Task` returned by `WhenAny` completes as soon as *one* of the input tasks finishes (succeeds, faults, or cancels).
  * **Result:** The `Task<Task>` (or `Task<Task<TResult>>`) returned by `WhenAny` provides access to the *specific* task that completed first. You then inspect that inner task (`.Result`, `.Exception`, `.IsCompletedSuccessfully`, etc.) to get its details.
  * **Exception Handling:** `WhenAny` itself does not throw an exception immediately if the *first* completed task faults. Instead, the `Task<Task>` will complete, and its `Result` will be the faulted inner `Task`. You then need to `await` or inspect that inner faulted task to trigger the exception propagation.
  * **Cancellation:** Similar to exceptions, if the first task to complete is canceled, `WhenAny`'s returned `Task` completes, and its `Result` is the canceled inner `Task`.

**When to use `Task.WhenAny`:**

  * **Race conditions:** When you have multiple ways to achieve a result, and you want to use the first one that completes (e.g., fetching data from mirrored servers, running multiple search algorithms).
  * **Timeouts:** To implement a timeout for an operation. You can combine the operation's `Task` with a `Task.Delay` task. `WhenAny` will complete when either the operation finishes or the delay expires.
  * **Cancellation of multiple operations:** To cancel all other ongoing operations once one operation finishes or a specific condition is met.
  * **Responsive UI:** To update the UI as soon as *any* part of a set of operations completes.

In Scenario 1, `Source B` completes first, and `WhenAny` immediately returns its task. The `await` then gets `Source B`'s data. Other tasks continue running. Scenario 2 effectively implements a timeout. Scenario 3 demonstrates that `WhenAny` returns the *first completed task*, regardless of its state (success, fault, or cancellation); you then need to inspect that specific task to handle its outcome.

### Key Differences Summarized:

| Feature             | `Task.WhenAll(...)`                           | `Task.WhenAny(...)`                               |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Completion** | When **all** input tasks are done (success, fault, or cancel). | When **any one** input task is done (success, fault, or cancel). |
| **Returned Task** | `Task` or `Task<TResult[]>`                   | `Task<Task>` or `Task<Task<TResult>>`           |
| **Result Access** | `await` directly yields `TResult[]` (if applicable). | `await` yields the *completed inner task*; then `await` its `Result` (if applicable). |
| **Exception Handling**| **Aggregates all exceptions** into an `AggregateException` (re-throws first one on `await`). | Does **not** aggregate. Returns the completed task, even if faulted. You must `await` or inspect the inner task's `Exception` to propagate. |
| **Use Cases** | Running multiple things concurrently and waiting for all to finish, aggregating all results. | Implementing timeouts, race conditions (first to complete wins), or responding to the first of many events. |
| **Resource Management**| Implies waiting for all tasks, potentially holding resources longer. | Allows reacting quickly to the first result; other tasks might need explicit cancellation if no longer needed. |

### Conclusion:

`Task.WhenAll` and `Task.WhenAny` are indispensable tools in your asynchronous programming toolkit.

  * **`Task.WhenAll`** is perfect when you need to kick off a bunch of independent async operations and then consolidate all their results or ensure all are finished before proceeding. Be mindful of its `AggregateException` behavior for error handling.
  * **`Task.WhenAny`** is ideal for "race" conditions, implementing timeouts, or reacting as soon as any one of a set of operations completes. Remember that it returns the *completed task itself*, requiring you to inspect that task for its actual result or fault.

By leveraging these methods, you can build highly concurrent, efficient, and responsive applications that make the most of C\#'s asynchronous capabilities.
