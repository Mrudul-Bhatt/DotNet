-----

## Continuation Tasks: `.ContinueWith(...)`

In asynchronous programming, you often need to perform a subsequent action *after* an initial asynchronous operation completes. The `await` keyword in C\# provides a very elegant and intuitive way to do this: the code that follows an `await` is essentially a continuation.

However, sometimes you need more fine-grained control over when and how a continuation runs, especially in scenarios involving:

  * Handling different completion states (success, fault, cancellation).
  * Chaining multiple tasks in complex sequences.
  * Integrating with older APIs or patterns that don't fully leverage `async`/`await`.
  * Migrating from older asynchronous patterns.

This is where the `Task.ContinueWith(...)` method comes into play. It allows you to schedule a new task (the continuation) to run when a preceding task (the antecedent) finishes.

### How `.ContinueWith(...)` Works

The `ContinueWith` method schedules a continuation task to be executed when the "antecedent" task (the `Task` on which `ContinueWith` is called) completes.

**Key Features:**

1.  **Chaining Tasks:** It explicitly creates a dependency: the continuation task will only start once the antecedent task has finished.
2.  **State Inspection:** The continuation delegate receives the antecedent `Task` as an argument. This allows the continuation to inspect the state of the antecedent task (e.g., `IsCompletedSuccessfully`, `IsCanceled`, `IsFaulted`, `Exception`, `Result`).
3.  **`TaskContinuationOptions`:** This is a powerful enum that provides granular control over when the continuation should run:
      * `None`: Runs when the antecedent completes in any state (success, fault, cancel).
      * `OnlyOnRanToCompletion`: Runs only if the antecedent completes successfully.
      * `OnlyOnFaulted`: Runs only if the antecedent faults (throws an unhandled exception).
      * `OnlyOnCanceled`: Runs only if the antecedent is canceled.
      * `NotOnRanToCompletion`, `NotOnFaulted`, `NotOnCanceled`: Run if the antecedent *does not* complete in the specified state.
      * `ExecuteSynchronously`: Tries to execute the continuation on the same thread that completed the antecedent. Can be dangerous if the antecedent completes on a UI thread.
      * `LongRunning`: Hints that the continuation might be long-running and should run on a separate, dedicated Thread Pool thread.
      * `AttachedToParent`: Makes the continuation a child task.
      * `DenyChildAttach`: Prevents child tasks from attaching.
      * `LazyCancellation`: The cancellation token for the continuation is not checked until the continuation task begins executing.
      * `HideScheduler`: Prevents the TaskScheduler from being propagated to the continuation.
      * `PreferFairness`: Schedules the task in a way that minimizes the chance of starvation of other tasks.
      * `RunContinuationsAsynchronously`: Ensures continuations run asynchronously, preventing deadlocks or thread pool starvation. **(Highly recommended in most scenarios)**

### `ContinueWith` vs. `await`:

  * **`await` (Preferred):** Syntactic sugar that simplifies continuations. It implicitly handles `SynchronizationContext` (marshaling back to UI thread), directly re-throws exceptions, and handles all completion states by default. It's generally cleaner and less error-prone.
  * **`ContinueWith` (Explicit):** Gives explicit control over scheduling, continuation options, and exception handling. It's more verbose and requires careful management of `SynchronizationContext` and `AggregateException`.

**Rule of Thumb:**
**Use `await` whenever possible.**
**Use `ContinueWith` only when `await` doesn't provide the necessary control (e.g., specific `TaskContinuationOptions`, specific `TaskScheduler` for the continuation).**

### Code Examples:

#### Example 1: Basic Chaining (`OnlyOnRanToCompletion`)

Demonstrates executing a continuation only if the initial task succeeds.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class BasicContinuation
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- Basic .ContinueWith Demonstration ---");
        Console.WriteLine($"[Main Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Starting antecedent task.");

        // Antecedent task: simulates fetching data
        Task<string> fetchDataTask = Task.Run(async () =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [FetchData Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Fetching data...");
            await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate network call
            Console.WriteLine($"  [FetchData Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Data fetched.");
            return "Fetched Data Result";
        });

        // Continuation task: processes data only if fetching succeeded
        Task processDataTask = fetchDataTask.ContinueWith(antecedentTask =>
        {
            // The continuation receives the antecedent task.
            // Check its status before proceeding.
            if (antecedentTask.Status == TaskStatus.RanToCompletion)
            {
                string data = antecedentTask.Result; // Get result from successful antecedent
                Console.WriteLine($"  [ProcessData Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Processing: '{data}'");
                // Simulate processing
                Thread.Sleep(500);
                Console.WriteLine($"  [ProcessData Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Data processed successfully.");
            }
            else
            {
                // This block won't be hit with OnlyOnRanToCompletion, but good practice
                Console.WriteLine($"  [ProcessData Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Antecedent task did not run to completion.");
            }
        }, TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnRanToCompletion | TaskContinuationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously); // Important options!

        Console.WriteLine($"[Main Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Main thread continues immediately after scheduling continuation.");

        // Wait for the entire chain to complete
        await processDataTask; // Await the continuation task

        Console.WriteLine($"[Main Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] All tasks in chain completed.");
        Console.WriteLine("--- Basic .ContinueWith Demonstration Finished ---");
    }
}
```

**Output (`BasicContinuation`):**

```
--- Basic .ContinueWith Demonstration ---
[Main Thread 1] Starting antecedent task.
[Main Thread 1] Main thread continues immediately after scheduling continuation.
  [FetchData Task 1, Thread 3] Fetching data...
  [FetchData Task 1, Thread 3] Data fetched.
  [ProcessData Task 2, Thread 4] Processing: 'Fetched Data Result'
  [ProcessData Task 2, Thread 4] Data processed successfully.
[Main Thread 1] All tasks in chain completed.
--- Basic .ContinueWith Demonstration Finished ---
```

The continuation task (`ProcessData Task`) only started after `FetchData Task` completed successfully. The main thread was not blocked while these tasks ran.

#### Example 2: Handling Faulted and Canceled Tasks

Demonstrates using `ContinueWith` to create separate handlers for different task completion states.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class FaultedCanceledContinuation
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- .ContinueWith for Faulted/Canceled Tasks ---");

        // Scenario 1: Task that faults
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Scenario 1: Faulted Task ---");
        Task faultedTask = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("  [Faulting Task] Starting...");
            Thread.Sleep(500);
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Simulated error in task!");
        });

        // Continuation for when the task faults
        Task faultHandler = faultedTask.ContinueWith(antecedent =>
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Fault Handler] Task faulted! Exception: {antecedent.Exception.InnerException.Message}");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }, TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted | TaskContinuationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously);

        // Continuation for when the task runs to completion (will not run here)
        Task successHandler1 = faultedTask.ContinueWith(antecedent =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("  [Success Handler 1] Task completed successfully (should not see this).");
        }, TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnRanToCompletion | TaskContinuationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously);

        await Task.WhenAll(faultHandler, successHandler1); // Wait for the handlers to complete

        // Scenario 2: Task that is canceled
        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Scenario 2: Canceled Task ---");
        CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
        Task canceledTask = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("  [Cancellable Task] Starting...");
            Thread.Sleep(500);
            cts.Token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); // Check for cancellation
            Console.WriteLine("  [Cancellable Task] Finished (should not see this).");
        }, cts.Token);

        // Trigger cancellation after a short delay
        Task.Run(() => { Thread.Sleep(200); cts.Cancel(); });

        // Continuation for when the task is canceled
        Task cancelHandler = canceledTask.ContinueWith(antecedent =>
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Cancel Handler] Task was canceled! Status: {antecedent.Status}");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }, TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnCanceled | TaskContinuationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously);

        // Continuation for when the task runs to completion (will not run here)
        Task successHandler2 = canceledTask.ContinueWith(antecedent =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("  [Success Handler 2] Task completed successfully (should not see this).");
        }, TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnRanToCompletion | TaskContinuationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously);

        await Task.WhenAll(cancelHandler, successHandler2); // Wait for the handlers to complete

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- .ContinueWith for Faulted/Canceled Tasks Finished ---");
    }
}
```

**Output (`FaultedCanceledContinuation`):**

```
--- .ContinueWith for Faulted/Canceled Tasks ---

--- Scenario 1: Faulted Task ---
  [Faulting Task] Starting...
  [Fault Handler] Task faulted! Exception: Simulated error in task!

--- Scenario 2: Canceled Task ---
  [Cancellable Task] Starting...
  [Cancel Handler] Task was canceled! Status: Canceled

--- .ContinueWith for Faulted/Canceled Tasks Finished ---
```

This output clearly shows that only the `OnlyOnFaulted` continuation ran for the faulted task, and only the `OnlyOnCanceled` continuation ran for the canceled task.

#### Example 3: `ExecuteSynchronously` (Use with Caution\!)

This option attempts to run the continuation on the same thread that completed the antecedent task. While it can reduce context switches, it's dangerous if the antecedent completes on a sensitive thread (like a UI thread) as it can block that thread.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class SynchronousContinuation
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- .ContinueWith(ExecuteSynchronously) Demonstration ---");
        Console.WriteLine($"[Main Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Main thread started.");

        // Simulate a task that finishes on a Thread Pool thread
        Task firstTask = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [First Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Completing first task.");
            Thread.Sleep(500); // Simulate some work
        });

        // Continuation designed to run synchronously (on the completing thread)
        Task syncContinuation = firstTask.ContinueWith(antecedent =>
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Cyan;
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Sync Continuation {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Running synchronously after First Task.");
            Thread.Sleep(200); // This blocks the thread that completed 'firstTask'
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Sync Continuation {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Finished synchronous continuation.");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }, TaskContinuationOptions.ExecuteSynchronously | TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnRanToCompletion);

        Console.WriteLine($"[Main Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Main thread waiting for continuation...");
        await syncContinuation; // Wait for the synchronous continuation to finish

        Console.WriteLine("\n--- Example with potentially blocking UI thread (DO NOT DO THIS IN REAL UI APPS) ---");
        // This is a dangerous pattern in UI applications!
        // Imagine this runs on a UI thread via SynchronizationContext
        var uiThreadScheduler = TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext(); // In a console app, this is Default

        // This task will be run on the current context (Main Thread in console)
        Task uiTask = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [UI-like Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] UI-like task starting.");
            Thread.Sleep(200);
            Console.WriteLine($"  [UI-like Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] UI-like task completing.");
        }, CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.None, uiThreadScheduler);

        // This continuation will run synchronously on the UI thread, potentially blocking it
        Task uiContinuation = uiTask.ContinueWith(antecedent =>
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
            Console.WriteLine($"  [UI-Blocking Continuation {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Running synchronously on UI thread!");
            // This blocking call WILL FREEZE the UI if run in a real UI application
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
            Console.WriteLine($"  [UI-Blocking Continuation {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Finished UI-blocking continuation.");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }, TaskContinuationOptions.ExecuteSynchronously | TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnRanToCompletion);

        Console.WriteLine($"[Main Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Main thread waiting for UI-blocking continuation (will be blocked).");
        await uiContinuation; // Main thread will be blocked during the 1-second sleep

        Console.WriteLine($"[Main Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Main thread finished.");
        Console.WriteLine("--- .ContinueWith(ExecuteSynchronously) Demonstration Finished ---");
    }
}
```

**Output (`SynchronousContinuation`):**

```
--- .ContinueWith(ExecuteSynchronously) Demonstration ---
[Main Thread 1] Main thread started.
  [First Task 1, Thread 3] Completing first task.
  [First Task 1, Thread 3] Finished first task.
  [Sync Continuation 2, Thread 3] Running synchronously after First Task.
  [Sync Continuation 2, Thread 3] Finished synchronous continuation.
[Main Thread 1] Main thread waiting for continuation...

--- Example with potentially blocking UI thread (DO NOT DO THIS IN REAL UI APPS) ---
  [UI-like Task 3, Thread 1] UI-like task starting.
  [UI-like Task 3, Thread 1] UI-like task completing.
  [UI-Blocking Continuation 4, Thread 1] Running synchronously on UI thread!
  [UI-Blocking Continuation 4, Thread 1] Finished UI-blocking continuation.
[Main Thread 1] Main thread waiting for UI-blocking continuation (will be blocked).
[Main Thread 1] Main thread finished.
--- .ContinueWith(ExecuteSynchronously) Demonstration Finished ---
```

Notice how `[Sync Continuation]` runs on `Thread 3`, which is the same thread that completed `[First Task]`. For the UI-like scenario, `[UI-Blocking Continuation]` runs on `Thread 1` (the Main Thread), simulating how it would freeze a UI.

#### Example 4: Chaining with `RunContinuationsAsynchronously` (Best Practice)

This option is crucial for preventing deadlocks and ensuring good responsiveness, especially when dealing with UI or server contexts. It ensures the continuation is scheduled on the default scheduler and doesn't block the antecedent's completion thread.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class AsyncContinuation
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("--- .ContinueWith(RunContinuationsAsynchronously) Demonstration ---");
        Console.WriteLine($"[Main Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Main thread started.");

        Task antecedent = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Antecedent Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Antecedent starting.");
            Thread.Sleep(500);
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Antecedent Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Antecedent completing.");
        });

        // The continuation uses RunContinuationsAsynchronously
        // This ensures it's scheduled on the Thread Pool (default scheduler)
        // and doesn't block the thread that completed the antecedent.
        Task continuation = antecedent.ContinueWith(t =>
        {
            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Continuation Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Continuation started.");
            Thread.Sleep(200); // Simulate some work
            Console.WriteLine($"  [Continuation Task {Task.CurrentId}, Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Continuation finished.");
            Console.ResetColor();
        }, TaskContinuationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously); // CRITICAL for safety and responsiveness

        Console.WriteLine($"[Main Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Main thread continues immediately.");
        await Task.Delay(100); // Allow some time for tasks to run

        Console.WriteLine($"[Main Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] Main thread waiting for entire chain.");
        await continuation;

        Console.WriteLine($"[Main Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] All finished.");
        Console.WriteLine("--- .ContinueWith(RunContinuationsAsynchronously) Demonstration Finished ---");
    }
}
```

**Output (`AsyncContinuation`):**

```
--- .ContinueWith(RunContinuationsAsynchronously) Demonstration ---
[Main Thread 1] Main thread started.
  [Antecedent Task 1, Thread 3] Antecedent starting.
[Main Thread 1] Main thread continues immediately.
[Main Thread 1] Main thread waiting for entire chain.
  [Antecedent Task 1, Thread 3] Antecedent completing.
  [Continuation Task 2, Thread 4] Continuation started. // Note: new thread
  [Continuation Task 2, Thread 4] Continuation finished.
[Main Thread 1] All finished.
--- .ContinueWith(RunContinuationsAsynchronously) Demonstration Finished ---
```

In this output, even though `Antecedent Task` completed on `Thread 3`, the `Continuation Task` started on a *different* `Thread 4`. This demonstrates that `RunContinuationsAsynchronously` effectively schedules the continuation on the default `TaskScheduler` (Thread Pool), preventing it from blocking `Thread 3` if `Thread 3` were a UI thread.

### Summary and Best Practices:

  * **Prefer `await` for most asynchronous operations.** It's simpler, safer, and handles context marshaling and exception propagation automatically.
  * **Use `.ContinueWith(...)` when you need specific control:**
      * To execute code based on the *completion state* of the antecedent task (e.g., `OnlyOnFaulted`, `OnlyOnCanceled`).
      * To chain multiple tasks explicitly.
      * To schedule the continuation on a *specific* `TaskScheduler` (e.g., a custom scheduler).
      * For advanced scenarios where `await`'s default behavior is insufficient.
  * **Always consider `TaskContinuationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously`** when using `ContinueWith` to ensure that your continuations don't block the thread that completed the antecedent task. This prevents deadlocks and maintains responsiveness, especially in GUI or server applications.
  * **Be careful with `TaskContinuationOptions.ExecuteSynchronously`:** Only use it if you are absolutely sure that the antecedent will not complete on a thread that you cannot afford to block (e.g., a UI thread). It's generally best to avoid this option unless profiling shows a critical performance need and you understand the risks.
  * **Exception Handling:** Remember that `ContinueWith` will wrap exceptions in an `AggregateException` if the antecedent faults. You must explicitly check `antecedent.Exception` and handle `AggregateException` in your continuation if you're not using `OnlyOnFaulted`. When `OnlyOnFaulted` is used, the `Exception` property of the `antecedent` will hold the `AggregateException`.

By understanding both `await` and `ContinueWith`, you gain a more complete mastery of asynchronous patterns in C\#.
